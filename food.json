Set aside.\n\nIn a large glass measuring cup measure the buttermilk. Add the shortening. With an immersion blender on high, blend the shortening into the buttermilk until smooth.\n\nUsing a box grater, grate the cold butter into the flour. Toss until all of the pieces are coated. Lightly pinch the butter pieces into the flour.\n\nLightly coat your work surface with nonstick cooking spray, then flour. (The spray keeps the flour in place.) Add the buttermilk/shortening mixture to the flour/butter mixture. Gently mix the dough with a rubber spatula until there are no dry bits of flour left. The dough should be slightly sticky.\n\nTransfer dough to the prepared work surface. Lightly coat your hands with flour and gently press the dough with the palms of your hands to form it into a smooth flat rectangle, 1/2-inch thick. Sprinkle the dough with flour, then fold it into thirds (like a letter). Pat the dough out again, sprinkle with a little flour, and fold it into thirds again. Turn the dough 90 degrees (this time folding in the open ends first.) Repeat one more time. Dough should no longer be sticky.\n\nWith a floured 2- or 2 1/2- inch biscuit cutter, cut out dough rounds. Flip the rounds over so that the smooth sides that were against the work surface face up and place on the prepared pan, 1-inch apart. Stack the scraps and press and cut again. Refrigerate until cold, about 15 minutes.\n\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Bake until the tops are golden brown and crisp, about 16 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving hot.\n\nCook\u2019s Note\n\nYou can let the biscuits cool completely, then freeze them for up to 2 months. To serve, thaw them and then bake in a 350 degrees F oven until toasted and warm. If only fat-free buttermilk is available, you can substitute it with a combination of 1 cup of full fat sour cream and 1/2 cup of whole milk.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\n #CarlaHall #FoodNetwork #FlakyButtermilkBiscuits\n\nCarla Hall's Flaky Buttermilk Biscuits | Food Network\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rNuUUShxrI",

Butter and flour a 9-by-13-inch cake pan.\n\nCombine the buttermilk and vanilla in a medium bowl. Combine the flour, the sugar, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat with the paddle attachment on low speed until well mixed. Add the oil and beat until evenly distributed. With the machine running, add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time and beat until fully incorporated. The mixture will look like coarse sand.\n\nAdd the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping the bowl occasionally. While beating, add the buttermilk mixture in a slow, steady stream. Beat just until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly.\n\nBake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.\n\nLet cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Pour as much caramel as desired over the cake.\n\nPoured Caramel:\n\nSet the butter in a large saucepot over medium heat. When it's halfway melted, add the sugar and salt. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture is dark golden brown. It will look grainy and the fat will separate from the sugar and then come back together.\n\nRemove from the heat and add the evaporated milk while whisking. Be careful! The caramel will bubble up. Scrape up any sugar that's stuck to the bottom of the pan. Make sure the sugar is completely dissolved.\n\nSet over low heat and cook, whisking often, until very smooth and creamy, about 1 hour. Remove from the heat and cool completely, stirring occasionally.\n\nCook\u2019s Note\n\nThe cake keeps at room temperature covered tightly for up to 3 days.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\n #CarlaHall #FoodNetwork #ClassicYellowCake\n\nCarla Hall's Classic Yellow Cake | Food Network\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnKXTeBKJgY",

Cover with water and bring to a boil. Drain and return the turkey necks to the pot. Add the bay leaf and cover with 10 cups of water. Bring to a simmer, then keep warm while you prepare the red beans ingredients, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the turkey necks and reserve the stock. Set both aside.\n\nFor the red beans: Heat the oil in an 8-quart heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Stir in the celery, onions and peppers and cook until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the thyme, garlic and bay leaves and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add the red beans, smoked turkey sausage, Worcestershire sauce and the reserved turkey necks. Add enough turkey stock to fully cover the beans (about 8 cups) and reserve any remaining stock. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally to keep the beans from sticking, until the beans are tender, and the turkey necks are falling apart, about 1 hour 30 minutes.  Uncover the pot, smash some of the beans on the side of the pot with the back of a large metal spoon to make them creamy, then cover and cook for 30 minutes more (see Cook\u2019s Note). \n\nMeanwhile, combine the cayenne, cumin, garlic powder, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon pepper in a small bowl. Combine the green onions and parsley in a small bowl or on your cutting board. Stir the seasoning mixture into the finished beans, taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. \n\nTo serve, spoon the beans over a plate of cooked rice. Garnish with the green onions and parsley mixture, sprinkle with hot sauce to taste and serve with garlic bread. \n\nCook\u2019s Note\n\nTo soak 2 pounds of dark red kidney beans, add them to a large bowl and fill with enough water to completely cover the beans. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The beans will split when properly soaked.

Cover with water and bring to a boil. Drain and return the turkey necks to the pot. Add the bay leaf and cover with 10 cups of water. Bring to a simmer, then keep warm while you prepare the red beans ingredients, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the turkey necks and reserve the stock. Set both aside.\n\nFor the red beans: Heat the oil in an 8-quart heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Stir in the celery, onions and peppers and cook until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the thyme, garlic and bay leaves and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add the red beans, smoked turkey sausage, Worcestershire sauce and the reserved turkey necks. Add enough turkey stock to fully cover the beans (about 8 cups) and reserve any remaining stock. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally to keep the beans from sticking, until the beans are tender, and the turkey necks are falling apart, about 1 hour 30 minutes.  Uncover the pot, smash some of the beans on the side of the pot with the back of a large metal spoon to make them creamy, then cover and cook for 30 minutes more (see Cook\u2019s Note). \n\nMeanwhile, combine the cayenne, cumin, garlic powder, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon pepper in a small bowl.

Stir the seasoning mixture into the finished beans, taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. \n\nTo serve, spoon the beans over a plate of cooked rice. Garnish with the green onions and parsley mixture, sprinkle with hot sauce to taste and serve with garlic bread. \n\nCook\u2019s Note\n\nTo soak 2 pounds of dark red kidney beans, add them to a large bowl and fill with enough water to completely cover the beans.

We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nGumbo Ya-Ya\nRECIPE COURTESY OF KENNETH TEMPLE\nLevel: Intermediate\nTotal: 1 hr 45 min\nActive: 45 min\nYield: 8 servings\n\nIngredients\n\n3/4 cup canola oil\n2 pounds chicken wings, drumettes and flats separated, tips removed \n1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons Creole seasoning  \n1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more as needed \n3 stalks celery, chopped \n1 medium Spanish or white onion, chopped  \n1 bell pepper, chopped  \n5 cloves garlic, finely chopped \n1 teaspoon cayenne pepper \n2 bay leaves \n5 sprigs fresh thyme \n12 cups low-sodium chicken stock \n24 ounces smoked sausage, sliced 1/4 inch thick \n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce \nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper \n3 cups cooked white rice, for serving \n1 bunch green onions (3 to 4 bulbs), sliced 1/4 inch thick, for serving \n1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves, for serving \n\nDirections\n\nHeat 1/2 cup of the oil an 8-quart heavy-bottomed pot over medium to medium-high heat. Coat the chicken wings with 2 tablespoons of the Creole seasoning in a large bowl. Pour 1/4 cup of the flour over the chicken and coat evenly, then slowly add additional flour as needed until all of the chicken is completely coated (see Cook's Note). Working in batches, fry the chicken wings until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the wings to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.\n\nCarefully add the remaining 1/4 cup oil to the pot and heat until smoking (there should be a thin faint white smoke coming off the oil). Whisk in the remaining 3/4 cup flour and cook, whisking continuously, over medium-high heat until it turns into a dark chocolate brown roux. If the roux is browning too quickly, remove the pot from the heat and continue whisking until the roux reaches the desired color. Turn the heat down to low and stir in the celery, onions and peppers with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom of the pan, until the vegetables are coated with the roux, about 1 minute. Add the garlic, cayenne, bay leaves, thyme and 2 teaspoons Creole seasoning and turn up the heat to medium-high. Whisk in the chicken stock in three parts to make sure it\u2019s fully incorporated. Add the chicken wings, sausage, Worcestershire sauce and 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Creole seasoning. Stir to combine. \n\nBring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, using a ladle to skim off any foam that rises to the top, until the gumbo is slightly reduced and thickened, about 1 hour. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons Creole seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Combine the green onions and parsley in a small bowl or on your cutting board.  \n\nTo serve, ladle the gumbo over bowls of cooked white rice and garnish with the green onion and parsley mixture. \n\nCook\u2019s Note\n\nThe amount of flour needed to coat the chicken wings may vary since wings can vary in size. Adding liquid to a roux will lighten the color of the gumbo. Remember, the darker the roux, the less thickening power it has.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\n#KennethTemple #GumboYaYa #AnIntroductionToCajunAndCreoleCooking #FoodNetwork\n\nKenneth Temple's Gumbo Ya-Ya | An Introduction to Cajun and Creole Cooking | Food Network\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRIrG7AgI6Q",

Join him in the kitchen as he teaches us how to make gumbo, jambalaya and more favorites.\n\nWelcome to Food Network, where learning to cook is as simple as clicking play! Grab your apron and get ready to get cookin' with some of the best chefs around the world. We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nGumbo Ya-Ya\nRECIPE COURTESY OF KENNETH TEMPLE\nLevel: Intermediate\nTotal: 1 hr 45 min\nActive: 45 min\nYield: 8 servings\n\nIngredients\n\n3/4 cup canola oil\n2 pounds chicken wings, drumettes and flats separated, tips removed \n1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons Creole seasoning  \n1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more as needed \n3 stalks celery, chopped \n1 medium Spanish or white onion, chopped  \n1 bell pepper, chopped  \n5 cloves garlic, finely chopped \n1 teaspoon cayenne pepper \n2 bay leaves \n5 sprigs fresh thyme \n12 cups low-sodium chicken stock \n24 ounces smoked sausage, sliced 1/4 inch thick \n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce \nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper \n3 cups cooked white rice, for serving \n1 bunch green onions (3 to 4 bulbs), sliced 1/4 inch thick, for serving \n1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves, for serving \n\nDirections\n\nHeat 1/2 cup of the oil an 8-quart heavy-bottomed pot over medium to medium-high heat. Coat the chicken wings with 2 tablespoons of the Creole seasoning in a large bowl. Pour 1/4 cup of the flour over the chicken and coat evenly, then slowly add additional flour as needed until all of the chicken is completely coated (see Cook's Note). Working in batches, fry the chicken wings until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the wings to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.\n\nCarefully add the remaining 1/4 cup oil to the pot and heat until smoking (there should be a thin faint white smoke coming off the oil). Whisk in the remaining 3/4 cup flour and cook, whisking continuously, over medium-high heat until it turns into a dark chocolate brown roux. If the roux is browning too quickly, remove the pot from the heat and continue whisking until the roux reaches the desired color. Turn the heat down to low and stir in the celery, onions and peppers with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom of the pan, until the vegetables are coated with the roux, about 1 minute. Add the garlic, cayenne, bay leaves, thyme and 2 teaspoons Creole seasoning and turn up the heat to medium-high. Whisk in the chicken stock in three parts to make sure it\u2019s fully incorporated. Add the chicken wings, sausage, Worcestershire sauce and 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Creole seasoning. Stir to combine. \n\nBring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, using a ladle to skim off any foam that rises to the top, until the gumbo is slightly reduced and thickened, about 1 hour. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons Creole seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Combine the green onions and parsley in a small bowl or on your cutting board.  \n\nTo serve, ladle the gumbo over bowls of cooked white rice and garnish with the green onion and parsley mixture. \n\nCook\u2019s Note\n\nThe amount of flour needed to coat the chicken wings may vary since wings can vary in size. Adding liquid to a roux will lighten the color of the gumbo. Remember, the darker the roux, the less thickening power it has.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\n#KennethTemple #GumboYaYa #AnIntroductionToCajunAndCreoleCooking #FoodNetwork\n\nKenneth Temple's Gumbo Ya-Ya | An Introduction to Cajun and Creole Cooking | Food Network\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRIrG7AgI6Q"

Pull the melted sugar around the edges toward the center of the un-melted sugar with a heatproof rubber spatula. Continue cooking, pulling the melted sugar, until all the sugar is melted and the caramel is uniformly dark amber (it should smell caramelly but not burnt), 10 to 12 minutes total. (If you still have undissolved lumps of sugar, stir it off heat until melted.) Pour the caramel into 8-by-2-inch deep cake pan in an even layer, 1/8 to 1/4 inch deep. Let the caramel cool; it will crack as it cools and that's ok.\n\nBring the cream, milk and vanilla bean to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from the heat and steep for 30 minutes. \n\nArrange a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  \n\nPut the eggs, salt and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a blender and puree on low speed until smooth and the sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute.  \n\nStrain the cream mixture into the egg mixture and blend at low speed to combine, discarding any solids. Skim the foam off the top and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Remove any remaining foam from the top and cover the dish tightly with foil.  \n\nLine a roasting pan with a clean kitchen towel; this will keep the baking dish from sliding and it will insulate the flan, preventing it from overcooking. Set the baking dish on a towel and pour boiling water into the roasting pan until it comes halfway up the sides of the baking dish; the flan should not be floating. Bake the flan until it looks set like gelatin(it will wobble when gently shaken), 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, remove the foil and let cool. Cover the dish with plastic and refrigerate until set and cold, at least 3 hours and up to 24. \n\nWhen ready to serve, run a paring knife around the edges of the flan to loosen. Invert it onto a platter. Serve cold. The flan can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Unmold and serve. \n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\n#RickMart\u00ednez #VanillaFlan #IntroductionToMexicanCooking #FoodNetwork\n\nRick Mart\u00ednez's Vanilla Flan | Introduction to Mexican Cooking | Food Network\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m23w-OqdKUw",

Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight.\n\u202f\nHeat the vegetable oil in a 6-quart Instant Pot\u00ae on the saute setting over medium-high heat (see Cook\u2019s Note). Add the veal to the pot and cook until seared and golden brown on both sides, about 7 minutes total.\n\nAdd the carrots, celery, leeks, fennel, garlic, thyme, bay leaf and parsley sprigs. Cook until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook 1 to 2 minutes more. Add the veal stock and wine. Secure the lid and cook on low pressure, 1 hour 30 minutes.\u202f\n\nRemove the pressure cooker from the heat and, using the quick-release valve, carefully open. \u202f\n\nRemove the veal and reserve. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a large pot. Cook over medium-high heat, skimming the surface to remove impurities, until reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon, 25 to 30 minutes.\u202fStir in the butter until melted.\n\nStir the veal and remaining 1 tablespoon chopped parsley into the reduced sauce.\n\nFor the gremolata: Soak the raisins in water until rehydrated and plump, 10 minutes.

Set aside.\u202f\n\nFor the risotto: Heat the olive oil in a large or 16-inch saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, 5 minutes. Add the rice, reduce to low heat and toast until the rice begins to smell nutty but does not have any color, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring continuously, until the wine is absorbed, 3 to 4 minutes. Ladle the hot chicken stock into the rice in increments, stirring gently without stopping, until the rice is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Stir in the cheese, butter and parsley.\u202f\n\nTo serve, spoon the risotto on platter, top with the veal garnish with grated Parmigiano Reggiano and the gremolata.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\n#AntoniaLofaso #OssoBuco #Risotto #FoodNetwork #TheJuliaChildChallenge\n\nAntonia Lofaso's Osso Buco Over Risotto | Inspired by The Julia Child Challenge | Food Network\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP-2jZZIsYw",

Top with another layer of parchment and cover with another baking sheet so the bacon is sandwiched tightly between the two.\n\nCook the bacon: Place the tray in the center of the oven and bake, undisturbed, for 20 minutes. Check the bacon by lifting the top tray and parchment. If it\u2019s not fairly crispy, return it to the oven and cook 10 to 15 minutes more. Check again. Keep in mind that when you remove the tray and transfer the bacon to a serving platter or individual plates, the bacon will \u201ccrisp\u201d up a little more. Be patient!\n\nGet ready: Arrange the tomato slices on a flat surface and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the sugar and spoon the relish over them.\n\nAssemble the sandwiches: Lay 2 slices of the bread on a flat surface. Coat one side of each with a layer of mayonnaise. Top each with 4 slices of tomato. Break the bacon into 2 to 3 pieces each and top the tomatoes with it. Sprinkle the vinegar on the lettuce and top the bacon with it. Add a layer of mayonnaise to the other 2 slices of bread and top the sandwiches.\n\nCopyright 2024 Television Food Network, G.P.

We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nChocolate Crinkle Cookies\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 3 hr 40 min (includes chilling and cooling times)\nActive: 40 min\nYield: about 30 cookies\n\nIngredients\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n2 teaspoons instant espresso powder\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon fine salt\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped\n1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into pieces\n1 cup packed light brown sugar\n3 large eggs\n1 cup confectioners' sugar\n\nDirections\n\nWhisk together the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a small bowl.\n\nMicrowave the chocolate and butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl in 1-minute increments, stirring in between, until melted and smooth. Alternatively, put the chocolate and butter in a medium heat-proof bowl and set over a medium pot filled with about 2 inches of water. The bottom of the bowl should not touch the water. Bring the water to a low simmer over medium heat and warm the butter and chocolate, stirring, until melted and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool slightly.\n\nBeat the brown sugar and eggs with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until thick, about 2 minutes. Scrape the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and beat until incorporated. Add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Refrigerate the dough until firm, at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\n\nPosition oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\n\nPut the confectioners' sugar in a small bowl. Scoop out tablespoonfuls of the dough and roll them into balls. Refrigerate half the dough balls. Toss the remaining balls in the sugar, coating them very generously (you shouldn't see any dough peeking through). Arrange the balls about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.\n\nBake until the cookies spread, the tops are dull in color and cracked and the edges are firm, 12 to 14 minutes.

Pastry chef Ben Hardy is here to help you NOT mess up Chocolate Crinkle Cookies \ud83c\udf6b\ud83c\udf6b #HowNotToMessUpCookies\nGet the recipe \u25b6https://foodtv.com/3xonXq3\nSubscribe to Food Network \u25b6 http://foodtv.com/YouTube\n\nWelcome to Food Network, where learning to cook is as simple as clicking play! Grab your apron and get ready to get cookin' with some of the best chefs around the world. We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nChocolate Crinkle Cookies\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 3 hr 40 min (includes chilling and cooling times)\nActive: 40 min\nYield: about 30 cookies\n\nIngredients\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n2 teaspoons instant espresso powder\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon fine salt\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped\n1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into pieces\n1 cup packed light brown sugar\n3 large eggs\n1 cup confectioners' sugar\n\nDirections\n\nWhisk together the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a small bowl.\n\nMicrowave the chocolate and butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl in 1-minute increments, stirring in between, until melted and smooth. Alternatively, put the chocolate and butter in a medium heat-proof bowl and set over a medium pot filled with about 2 inches of water. The bottom of the bowl should not touch the water. Bring the water to a low simmer over medium heat and warm the butter and chocolate, stirring, until melted and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool slightly.\n\nBeat the brown sugar and eggs with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until thick, about 2 minutes. Scrape the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and beat until incorporated. Add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Refrigerate the dough until firm, at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\n\nPosition oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\n\nPut the confectioners' sugar in a small bowl. Scoop out tablespoonfuls of the dough and roll them into balls. Refrigerate half the dough balls. Toss the remaining balls in the sugar, coating them very generously (you shouldn't see any dough peeking through). Arrange the balls about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.\n\nBake until the cookies spread, the tops are dull in color and cracked and the edges are firm, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. When the baking sheets are cool, repeat with the remaining dough balls. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.\n\nCook\u2019s Note\nWhen measuring flour, we spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off the excess.

Place the sweet potatoes in a 2-quart baking dish. Set aside.\n\nIn a medium pot, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the sugar and stir until smooth. Drain the pineapple in a strainer, reserving the juice. Stir in about half the pineapple and half the pineapple juice; reserve the rest of the pineapple and juice for another use. Stir in the cinnamon, cloves and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, remove from the heat and add the vanilla extract.  Pour the mixture directly over the sweet potatoes. \n\nCover the dish with aluminum foil and bake until the sweet potatoes are just tender, about 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until the sweet potatoes are caramelized, 20 to 25 minutes more.  \n\nPlate and serve immediately. Pour extra sauce from the bottom of the baking dish on top.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\n#KardeaBrown #DeliciousMissBrown #FoodNetwork #CandiedYams\n\nKardea Brown's Grandma\u2019s Candied Yams with Pineapple \u200b\u200b| Delicious Miss Brown | Food Network\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpaCk_Y_Xfs"

Cook until the onions have softened, about 3 minutes. Add the Dungeness crab and wine and bring to a boil.\n\nMeanwhile, to a large high-sided saute pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons oil, the remaining fennel, white onion and ginger and saute until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the saffron. Carefully strain the broth directly into the ginger and onion pan, breaking up the crab and reserving for later.

Remove and place in a large bowl with the lobster, tomatoes and reserved Dungeness crab.\n\nPour the reduced broth over all the seafood and toss to combine. Add to the soaked paper bag. Roll the top of the bag to seal, creating a pouch, and lay, roll side-down, on the baking sheet.\nBake for 20 minutes. Bring to the table on a platter and cut open with some scissors.

This stew is a testament to the benefit of having berbere in your cupboard \u2014 It takes a simple braised chicken that you can make any night of the week from basic to really special. Berbere is the spice mix of Ethiopia and Eritrea, and it differs from region to region, family to family, even neighbor to neighbor.\nGet the recipe \u25b6 https://foodtv.com/35nHgCO\nSubscribe to Food Network \u25b6 http://foodtv.com/YouTube\n\nAbout the Show: Hawa Hassan shares how to make some of her favorite African dishes from her cookbook, In Bibi's Kitchen.\n\nWelcome to Food Network, where learning to cook is as simple as clicking play! Grab your apron and get ready to get cookin' with some of the best chefs around the world. We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nDoro Wat (Stewed Chicken Legs with Berbere and Eggs)\nRECIPE COURTESY OF HAWA HASSAN\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 1 hr 35 min\nActive: 35 min\nYield: 4 to 6 servings\n\nIngredients \n\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee\n2 large red onions, finely diced\n6 garlic cloves, minced\n2 tablespoons minced ginger\n3 tablespoons Berbere, recipe follows, or store-bought berbere\n1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed\n2 medium vine-ripened tomatoes, finely diced\n1 cup water\n8 chicken drumsticks\n6 large eggs, hard-boiled and peeled\nCooked rice for serving, optional\n\nBerbere:\n\n1/4 cup New Mexico chile powder\n2 tablespoons sweet paprika \n1 teaspoon ground cayenne \n1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom \n1/2 teaspoon ground coriander \n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin \n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger \n1/2 teaspoon mustard powder \n1/2 teaspoon granulated onion \n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice \n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon \n1/4 teaspoon ground cloves \n1/4 teaspoon garlic powder \n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n\nDirections\n\nMelt the butter in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.\n\nStir in the Berbere and salt and cook, stirring, until very aromatic, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring until they\u2019ve reduced down and the mixture is almost dry, about 10 minutes. Add the water, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Season the chicken pieces all over with salt and then nestle them into the pot. Cover and cook, uncovering the pot every so often to stir, until the chicken is very tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Add the eggs and cook, stirring every so often, until the eggs are heated through and nicely coated with the sauce, about 10 minutes.\n\nUse a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken legs and eggs to a serving dish. Increase the heat to high, return the sauce to a boil, and cook until slightly reduced and thickened, about 5 minutes. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and eggs. Serve immediately. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a few days and rewarmed in a heavy pot set over low heat (stir while you heat).\n\nBerbere:\nYield: Makes about 1/2 cup\n\nCombine all the spices in a small skillet. Toast over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Let cool completely. This spice blend will keep, tightly sealed, in your pantry for several months. For longer storage, keep in the freezer.\n\nAdapted with permission from In Bibi\u2019s Kitchen by Hawa Hassan with Julia Turshen, copyright \u00a9 2020.

                        "description": "Hawa makes Doro Wat, a traditional Ethiopian chicken stew. This stew is a testament to the benefit of having berbere in your cupboard \u2014 It takes a simple braised chicken that you can make any night of the week from basic to really special. Berbere is the spice mix of Ethiopia and Eritrea, and it differs from region to region, family to family, even neighbor to neighbor.\nGet the recipe \u25b6 https://foodtv.com/35nHgCO\nSubscribe to Food Network \u25b6 http://foodtv.com/YouTube\n\nAbout the Show: Hawa Hassan shares how to make some of her favorite African dishes from her cookbook, In Bibi's Kitchen.\n\nWelcome to Food Network, where learning to cook is as simple as clicking play! Grab your apron and get ready to get cookin' with some of the best chefs around the world. We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nDoro Wat (Stewed Chicken Legs with Berbere and Eggs)\nRECIPE COURTESY OF HAWA HASSAN\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 1 hr 35 min\nActive: 35 min\nYield: 4 to 6 servings\n\nIngredients \n\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee\n2 large red onions, finely diced\n6 garlic cloves, minced\n2 tablespoons minced ginger\n3 tablespoons Berbere, recipe follows, or store-bought berbere\n1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed\n2 medium vine-ripened tomatoes, finely diced\n1 cup water\n8 chicken drumsticks\n6 large eggs, hard-boiled and peeled\nCooked rice for serving, optional\n\nBerbere:\n\n1/4 cup New Mexico chile powder\n2 tablespoons sweet paprika \n1 teaspoon ground cayenne \n1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom \n1/2 teaspoon ground coriander \n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin \n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger \n1/2 teaspoon mustard powder \n1/2 teaspoon granulated onion \n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice \n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon \n1/4 teaspoon ground cloves \n1/4 teaspoon garlic powder \n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n\nDirections\n\nMelt the butter in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.\n\nStir in the Berbere and salt and cook, stirring, until very aromatic, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring until they\u2019ve reduced down and the mixture is almost dry, about 10 minutes. Add the water, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Season the chicken pieces all over with salt and then nestle them into the pot. Cover and cook, uncovering the pot every so often to stir, until the chicken is very tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Add the eggs and cook, stirring every so often, until the eggs are heated through and nicely coated with the sauce, about 10 minutes.\n\nUse a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken legs and eggs to a serving dish. Increase the heat to high, return the sauce to a boil, and cook until slightly reduced and thickened, about 5 minutes. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and eggs. Serve immediately. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a few days and rewarmed in a heavy pot set over low heat (stir while you heat).\n\nBerbere:\nYield: Makes about 1/2 cup\n\nCombine all the spices in a small skillet. Toast over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Let cool completely. This spice blend will keep, tightly sealed, in your pantry for several months. For longer storage, keep in the freezer.\n\nAdapted with permission from In Bibi\u2019s Kitchen by Hawa Hassan with Julia Turshen, copyright \u00a9 2020.

Grab your apron and get ready to get cookin' with some of the best chefs around the world. We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nThe search to find the greatest holiday baker begins as twelve amateur bakers enter the kitchen, where they show off their family traditions and superb baking skills. To survive the challenges from week to week, they must prove their abilities in front of our tough-love judges: Duff Goldman, Nancy Fuller and Carla Hall. Hosted by Jesse Palmer, this baking championship is the sweetest way to celebrate this holiday season.\n\nMini Spiced Bundt Cake Wreaths\nRECIPE COURTESY OF ZAC YOUNG\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 2 hr 15 min (includes cooling time)\nActive: 45 min\nYield: Makes 12 mini bundt cakes\n\nIngredients\n\nMini Bundt Cakes:\n2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans\n2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook's Note)\n1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 2/3 cups granulated sugar\n4 large eggs, at room temperature\n1/2 cup sour cream\n1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract\n3/4 cup buttermilk\n\nGlaze and Decorating:\n3 cups confectioners' sugar\n3 tablespoons bourbon, plus more as needed (see Cook's Note)\n2 tablespoons whole milk, plus more as needed\n2 to 3 teaspoons green food coloring\nRed, green and white sprinkles, for decorating\nRed sour candy straws, cut into 4-inch-long pieces, for decorating\n\nDirections\n\nSpecial equipment: two 6-cavity mini bundt cake pans\n\nFor the mini bundt cakes: preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the cups of two 6-cavity mini bundt cake pans, making sure to get in all the crevices; set aside. Whisk the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.\n\nBeat the 2 sticks butter and the granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the sour cream and vanilla. (The batter may look curdled.) Reduce the mixer speed to medium low and add the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the buttermilk; beat until just combined. \nSpoon the batter into the prepared pans, filling each cavity about 3/4 full and smoothing the top if necessary. Bake until the cakes are golden, starting to pull away from the edges of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool 15 minutes in the pans; loosen the edges of the cakes with a toothpick or wooden skewer and invert onto the rack to cool completely. \n\nFor the glaze and decorating: Once the cakes are completely cool, whisk together the confectioners' sugar, bourbon, milk and green food coloring in a small bowl until smooth and thick. Add up to 1 more tablespoon bourbon or milk if the mixture is too thick for dipping (it should be the consistency of honey). \n\nWorking one at a time, dip each cake in the green-tinted glaze, letting excess drip back into the bowl, then return to the rack and sprinkle generously with red, green and white sprinkles. Tie a piece of sour candy straw into a knot, then press into top of each bundt cake for the \"bow.\" Let the glaze set completely, about 30 minutes. \n\nCook\u2019s Note\nWhen measuring flour, we spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off excess. (Scooping directly from the bag compacts the flour, resulting in dry baked goods.)\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f Swap the bourbon for whole milk or water to make these treats alcohol-free and kid friendly.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\n#ZacYoung #HolidayBakingChampionship #FoodNetwork #Wreath #Cakes\n\nMini Spiced Bundt Cake Wreaths with Zac Young | Holiday Baking Championship | Food Network\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6AYrTI7iio&feature=youtu.be",

Hosted by Jesse Palmer, this baking championship is the sweetest way to celebrate this holiday season.\n\nMini Spiced Bundt Cake Wreaths\nRECIPE COURTESY OF ZAC YOUNG\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 2 hr 15 min (includes cooling time)\nActive: 45 min\nYield: Makes 12 mini bundt cakes\n\nIngredients\n\nMini Bundt Cakes:\n2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans\n2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook's Note)\n1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 2/3 cups granulated sugar\n4 large eggs, at room temperature\n1/2 cup sour cream\n1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract\n3/4 cup buttermilk\n\nGlaze and Decorating:\n3 cups confectioners' sugar\n3 tablespoons bourbon, plus more as needed (see Cook's Note)\n2 tablespoons whole milk, plus more as needed\n2 to 3 teaspoons green food coloring\nRed, green and white sprinkles, for decorating\nRed sour candy straws, cut into 4-inch-long pieces, for decorating\n\nDirections\n\nSpecial equipment: two 6-cavity mini bundt cake pans\n\nFor the mini bundt cakes: preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the cups of two 6-cavity mini bundt cake pans, making sure to get in all the crevices; set aside. Whisk the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.\n\nBeat the 2 sticks butter and the granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the sour cream and vanilla. (The batter may look curdled.) Reduce the mixer speed to medium low and add the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the buttermilk; beat until just combined. \nSpoon the batter into the prepared pans, filling each cavity about 3/4 full and smoothing the top if necessary. Bake until the cakes are golden, starting to pull away from the edges of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool 15 minutes in the pans; loosen the edges of the cakes with a toothpick or wooden skewer and invert onto the rack to cool completely. \n\nFor the glaze and decorating: Once the cakes are completely cool, whisk together the confectioners' sugar, bourbon, milk and green food coloring in a small bowl until smooth and thick. Add up to 1 more tablespoon bourbon or milk if the mixture is too thick for dipping (it should be the consistency of honey). \n\nWorking one at a time, dip each cake in the green-tinted glaze, letting excess drip back into the bowl, then return to the rack and sprinkle generously with red, green and white sprinkles. Tie a piece of sour candy straw into a knot, then press into top of each bundt cake for the \"bow.\" Let the glaze set completely, about 30 minutes. \n\nCook\u2019s Note\nWhen measuring flour, we spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off excess. (Scooping directly from the bag compacts the flour, resulting in dry baked goods.)\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f Swap the bourbon for whole milk or water to make these treats alcohol-free and kid friendly.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\n#ZacYoung #HolidayBakingChampionship #FoodNetwork #Wreath #Cakes\n\nMini Spiced Bundt Cake Wreaths with Zac Young | Holiday Baking Championship | Food Network\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6AYrTI7iio&feature=youtu.be"

Add the tomatillos, garlic cloves, ancho chile, poblano chile and onion. Char on all sides until blackened in parts, then remove as charred to a cutting board. (Depending on their size, each vegetable or chile will char at a different rate.)\n\nPlace the charred ancho chile in a small bowl and pour over enough hot water to cover. Allow to sit until the chile is softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the stem and seeds and reserve the water to adjust the consistency of your salsa, if needed.\n\nRemove the stem and seeds from the poblano and the skins from the garlic and onion.\n\nPut the ancho, poblano, garlic, onion, tomatillos, cilantro, agave, tomatoes and lime juice in a food processor and blend until mostly smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\nFor the burrito: Coat the steak in the adobo seasoning. If you have the time and inclination, place the seasoned steak on a wire rack set in a sheet pan in the fridge overnight to ensure a super charred crust!\nHeat a well-oiled grill or grill pan on high heat.\n\nGrill the steak until super charred, 7 to 8 minutes per side. Let the steak rest on a plate for at least 10 minutes or up to 30. Chop the steak into small pieces. Mix back in any accumulated juices and season to taste with more adobo if necessary.\n\nIn a tortilla, schmear sour cream in an even layer from end to end. On top of the sour cream, \u201cglue down\u201d an even, end-to-end layer of iceberg, then an even layer of diced tomatoes, then a thin layer of avocado followed by a final layer of cheese.\n\nPlace some chopped skirt steak on top of cheese and roll up the burrito.\nPlace the burrito on a flat griddle drizzled with oil over medium heat until at least two sides are slightly golden. Repeat to make 3 more burritos.\nServe with the salsa verde and fire-roasted red salsa.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\nJeff Mauro's Chicago-Style Steak Burrito | The Kitchen | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/iIgyNSt9jjM",

On a plate, place salt and pepper. Dredge chops in seasoning. In a medium skillet over medium heat, saute the bacon, chopped onions, thyme, and sage until the bacon is almost crispy and the onions are beginning to caramelize around the edges, about 10 minutes. Pour mixture into a bowl. Add apples, butter, 2 tablespoons of pineapple-orange juice and cinnamon. Season with salt and pepper. Stuff each chop with apple mixture and hold together with skewers. In same skillet over medium-high heat, add enough oil to coat the pan and sear both sides of the chops until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Add 1 cup pineapple-orange juice and remaining onion wedges around the chops. Season with salt and pepper and bake until cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chops, basting 2 to 3 times. Remove pork chops from pan and let rest 10 minutes. Add remaining pineapple-orange juice and scrape up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add lemon zest and parsley. Pour sauce over pork chops.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\nSunny Anderson's Apple and Onion-Stuffed Pork Chops | Cooking For Real | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/rE_92-orGNA",

On a plate, place salt and pepper. Dredge chops in seasoning. In a medium skillet over medium heat, saute the bacon, chopped onions, thyme, and sage until the bacon is almost crispy and the onions are beginning to caramelize around the edges, about 10 minutes. Pour mixture into a bowl. Add apples, butter, 2 tablespoons of pineapple-orange juice and cinnamon. Season with salt and pepper. Stuff each chop with apple mixture and hold together with skewers. In same skillet over medium-high heat, add enough oil to coat the pan and sear both sides of the chops until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Add 1 cup pineapple-orange juice and remaining onion wedges around the chops. Season with salt and pepper and bake until cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chops, basting 2 to 3 times. Remove pork chops from pan and let rest 10 minutes. Add remaining pineapple-orange juice and scrape up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add lemon zest and parsley. Pour sauce over pork chops.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\nSunny Anderson's Apple and Onion-Stuffed Pork Chops | Cooking For Real | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/rE_92-orGNA"

We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nPumpkin Bundt Cake with White Chocolate Glaze\nRECIPE COURTESY OF ALEX GUARNASCHELLI\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 3 hr (includes cooling time)\nActive: 40 min\nYield: 10 to 12 servings\n\nIngredients\n\nCream Cheese Filling:\n8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1 large egg\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nCake:\n1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter\n3 cups all-purpose flour\n1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n1 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/2 teaspoon ground cloves\n1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\nOne 15-ounce can pumpkin puree\n1 1/4 cups dark brown sugar\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons molasses\n4 large eggs\n1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil\nNonstick spray, for the pan\n\nGlaze:\n3/4 cup coarsely chopped white chocolate (6 ounces)\n1/4 cup whole milk\n2 to 3 grates orange zest\n\nDirections\n\nSpecial equipment: a 10-inch Bundt pan\n\nFor the cream cheese filling: In a large bowl, whisk the cream cheese, granulated sugar and nutmeg together until smooth. Add the egg and vanilla. Spoon the filling into a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate so it becomes firm.\n\nFor the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\n\nPlace a medium metal (heatproof) bowl next to the stove. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and watch as it melts and turns light brown, about 5 minutes. Before it becomes overly browned or burned, pour the butter into the metal bowl and let it cool.\n\nIn a large bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, baking powder, salt and baking soda. In another bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree with the sugars, molasses and eggs until smooth, then whisk in the olive oil. Gently whisk the flour mixture into the wet ingredients until smooth. Stir in the browned butter. (Do not overmix.)\n\nThoroughly spray a 10-inch Bundt pan with nonstick spray, then pour in about half of the batter in an even layer. Cut a hole in one of the bottom corners of the plastic bag of filling and squeeze the cream cheese filling (like toothpaste out of a tube) in a circle in the center of the batter. Imagine it like a hidden cream cheese ring in the center. Gently spoon the remaining half of the batter on top to conceal the cream cheese. Don\u2019t mix or spread the batter.\n\nPlace the pan in the center of the oven and bake until the tip of a knife inserted in the center emerges free of batter, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool 30 minutes in the pan, then unmold onto a serving platter and cool.\n\nFor the glaze: In a small, heatproof bowl, melt the white chocolate over a pot of gently simmering water (a double boiler). In a small saucepan, warm the milk over low heat. When the chocolate has melted, remove from the heat and stir into the milk until smooth. Add the orange zest. Let cool and thicken for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours before pouring right over the cake.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork \n\nAlex Guarnaschelli's Pumpkin Bundt Cake with White Chocolate Glaze | The Kitchen | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/zvHCaJ7hgf8",

We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nPumpkin Bundt Cake with White Chocolate Glaze\nRECIPE COURTESY OF ALEX GUARNASCHELLI\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 3 hr (includes cooling time)\nActive: 40 min\nYield: 10 to 12 servings\n\nIngredients\n\nCream Cheese Filling:\n8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1 large egg\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nCake:\n1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter\n3 cups all-purpose flour\n1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n1 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/2 teaspoon ground cloves\n1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\nOne 15-ounce can pumpkin puree\n1 1/4 cups dark brown sugar\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons molasses\n4 large eggs\n1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil\nNonstick spray, for the pan\n\nGlaze:\n3/4 cup coarsely chopped white chocolate (6 ounces)\n1/4 cup whole milk\n2 to 3 grates orange zest\n\nDirections\n\nSpecial equipment: a 10-inch Bundt pan\n\nFor the cream cheese filling: In a large bowl, whisk the cream cheese, granulated sugar and nutmeg together until smooth. Add the egg and vanilla. Spoon the filling into a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate so it becomes firm.\n\nFor the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\n\nPlace a medium metal (heatproof) bowl next to the stove. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and watch as it melts and turns light brown, about 5 minutes. Before it becomes overly browned or burned, pour the butter into the metal bowl and let it cool.\n\nIn a large bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, baking powder, salt and baking soda. In another bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree with the sugars, molasses and eggs until smooth, then whisk in the olive oil. Gently whisk the flour mixture into the wet ingredients until smooth. Stir in the browned butter. (Do not overmix.)\n\nThoroughly spray a 10-inch Bundt pan with nonstick spray, then pour in about half of the batter in an even layer. Cut a hole in one of the bottom corners of the plastic bag of filling and squeeze the cream cheese filling (like toothpaste out of a tube) in a circle in the center of the batter. Imagine it like a hidden cream cheese ring in the center. Gently spoon the remaining half of the batter on top to conceal the cream cheese. Don\u2019t mix or spread the batter.\n\nPlace the pan in the center of the oven and bake until the tip of a knife inserted in the center emerges free of batter, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool 30 minutes in the pan, then unmold onto a serving platter and cool.\n\nFor the glaze: In a small, heatproof bowl, melt the white chocolate over a pot of gently simmering water (a double boiler). In a small saucepan, warm the milk over low heat. When the chocolate has melted, remove from the heat and stir into the milk until smooth. Add the orange zest. Let cool and thicken for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours before pouring right over the cake.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork \n\nAlex Guarnaschelli's Pumpkin Bundt Cake with White Chocolate Glaze | The Kitchen | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/zvHCaJ7hgf8"

Add the chicken and toss to coat. Marinate at least 30 minutes, or in the refrigerator up to overnight.\n\nFor the sauce: When you're ready to make the curry, place a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil and butter. When the butter has melted, add the Ginger-Garlic Paste and serrano peppers. Saute until lightly browned around the edges. Add the tomato paste and cook until the tomato has darkened in color, about 3 minutes. Add the garam masala and the paprika and saute for about 1 minute to draw out their flavors.\n\nAdd the tomatoes, salt, and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer, and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes. You may need more water depending on how much liquid the tomatoes give off.\n\nMeanwhile, fire up your grill. When it is nice and hot, lightly brush it with oil. Place the chicken on the grill, shaking off some of the excess marinade. Cook until it's charred, about 2 minutes on each side. (Don't worry that the chicken will still be a little uncooked, it finishes cooking in the sauce).\n\nPour the sauce into a blender or food processor, or use an immersion blender, and process until smooth. Pour back into the skillet and bring back up to a boil. Add the chicken and fenugreek leaves, if using. Take the heat down to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes. Add the cream and stir through. Garnish with minced fresh cilantro, and serve over rice, with naan, or a crusty piece of bread!\n\nGinger-Garlic Paste:\nThrow the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste. There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste.\nSave what you don't use in a small glass jar. It should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. It's a delicious addition to marinades, pasta sauces, stir fry sauces, slow-cooker recipes, gravy etc. We always had a jar of this stuff in our fridge growing up.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\n\u25ba FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp \n\u25ba WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com  \n\u25ba FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com \n\u25ba FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork \n\u25ba INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork \n\u25ba TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork \n\n#ChickenTikkaMasala #AartiParty #FoodNetwork\n\nAarti Sequeira's 5-Star Chicken Tikka Masala | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/B1p-juLa-4A",

We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nNaan: Indian Oven-Baked Flat Bread\nRECIPE COURTESY OF AARTI SEQUEIRA\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 3 hr 30 min\nPrep: 15 min\nInactive: 3 hr\nCook: 15 min\nYield: 6 loaves\n\nIngredients\n\n1 teaspoon active dry yeast\n2 teaspoons sugar\n2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling, see Cook's Note*\n1 teaspoon fine sea salt\n1/8 teaspoon baking powder\n3 tablespoons plain yogurt\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon kalonji (nigella seeds), optional, see Cook's Note**\n1 teaspoon fennel seeds, optional, see Cook's Note**\nMelted butter for slathering on the finished naans\nCoarse sea salt for sprinkling\n\nDirections\n\nIn a large glass, dissolve the dry yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar with 3/4 cup warm water (about 100 degrees F). Let it sit on your counter until it's frothy, about 10 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, sift the flour, salt, remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar and baking powder into a large, deep bowl.\n\nOnce the yeast is frothy, add the yogurt and the olive oil into the glass, and stir to combine. Pour the yogurt mixture into the dry ingredients and add the kalonji and fennel seeds, if using, and gently mix the ingredients together with a fork. When the dough is about to come together, use your hands to mix. It will feel like there isn't enough flour at first, but keep going until it transforms into a soft, slightly sticky and pliable dough. As soon as it comes together, stop kneading. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let it sit in a warm, draft-free place for 2 to 4 hours.\nWhen you're ready to roll, make sure you have two bowls on your counter: one with extra flour in it, and one with water. The dough will be extremely soft and sticky-this is good! Separate the dough into 6 equal portions and lightly roll each one in the bowl of extra flour to keep them from sticking to each other.\n\nShape the naan. Using a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a teardrop shape, narrower at the top than at the bottom. It should be 8 to 9-inches long, 4-inches wide at its widest point and about 1/4-inch thick. Once you've formed the general shape, you can also pick it up by one end and wiggle it; the dough's own weight will stretch it out a little. Repeat this method with the rest of the dough. (If you're making the gluten-free version, you'll have better luck pressing the dough out with your fingertips, than rolling.)\n\nWarm a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until it's nearly smoking. Make sure you have a lid large enough to fit the skillet and have a bowl of melted butter at the ready.\n\nDampen your hands in the bowl of water and pick up one of your naans, flip-flopping it from one hand to the other to lightly dampen it. Gently lay it in the skillet and set your timer for 1 minute. The dough should start to bubble.\n\nAfter about 1 minute, flip the naan. It should be blistered and somewhat blackened, don't worry - that's typical of traditional naan! Cover the skillet with the lid and cook 30 seconds to 1 minute more.\nRemove the naan from the skillet, brush with a bit of butter and sprinkle with a little coarse sea salt. Place the naan in a tea towel-lined dish. Repeat with the rest of the naans and serve.\n\nCook\u2019s Note\n* If you would like to make this gluten-free, you can substitute in 2 1/4 cups of a gluten-free all-purpose flour mix for the regular flour, plus 1 1/4 teaspoons of xanthum gum. **The kalonji and fennel seeds are not traditional, but I love the burst of onion and mild licorice flavor they add. You can find them pretty cheaply at your local Indian market.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\n\u25ba FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp \n\u25ba WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com  \n\u25ba FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com \n\u25ba FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork \n\u25ba INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork \n\u25ba TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork \n\n#NaanIndianOvenBakedFlatBread #AartiParty #FoodNetwork\n\nAarti Sequeira's Homemade Naan | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/eZYWJhlhfjI",

Discard the ends. Toss the asparagus with oil and salt to taste. Grill the asparagus until slightly charred and pliable on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes for pencil or 5 to 7 minutes for standard. Remove to a platter and reserve at room temperature. Grill each slice of bread until crispy and slightly charred on both sides. Rub each piece of bread vigorously with the raw garlic clove. Reserve with the asparagus.\r\n\r\nFill a bowl with cold tap water and the ice cubes. This will be the holding area for the eggs after they have been poached. Keep the bowl near the stove.\r\n\r\nFill a medium saucepan two-thirds of the way with water. Add the white vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat on the burner until the bubbles in the water have subsided. Gently crack and drop each egg into the water. Cook the eggs for 3 to 4 minutes. When done, the whites will be cooked through and the yolks will be warm but still liquid. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs from the saucepan and place in the bowl of cold water. Reserve.\r\n\r\nTo assemble the salad: Toss the arugula with half of the lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Gently toss the salad until coated with the lemon and olive oil. Add more lemon juice and oil if needed. TASTE IT! The salad should be dressed and flavorful but not soggy. Divide the arugula among 4 individual plates. Arrange the asparagus on top of the arugula on each plate.\r\n\r\nWhile dressing the salad, bring the saucepan of poaching water to a simmer. Gently return the eggs to the saucepan until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. When the eggs are hot, remove them from the pan with a slotted spoon and gently blot on a tea towel to remove any excess water. Immediately place 1 egg on top of the asparagus on each plate. Sprinkle each with some salt, Parmigiano and lemon zest. Drizzle each piece of grilled bread generously with olive oil and cut in half on the bias.

Add sauce, basil, salt and pepper. Cook on medium heat for 15 minutes.\n\nFor the pappardelle pasta: Make a bed of all-purpose flour, then make a well and add eggs. Fold all together, adding in more flour if needed, and knead until a dough ball is formed, then set aside and cover for 30 minutes.\n\nRun dough through a pasta sheeter to form pappardelle pasta (broad flat noodles).\n\nFor the meatballs: Combine the beef, pork, veal, panko, Parmesan, salt, pepper and eggs in a bowl. \nMixture should be on the drier side. If need be, add more panko. Form quarter-size meatballs. Heat a medium frying pan with oil and fry each meatball to a golden brown color. \n\nFor the pasta al forno: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\n\nAdd sauce to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, along with the ricotta. Stir together, then add mozzarella and the meatballs. Let the cheese melt down.\n\nMeanwhile, drop the pasta into boiling salted water for about 7 minutes. Strain and add to the baking dish. Mix around, then bake in oven for 10 minutes.\n\nCook\u2019s Note\nStore-bought pappardelle is fine, too.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/guyfieri \nhttps://www.facebook.com/GuyFieri/ \nhttps://twitter.com/GuyFieri  \n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25ba WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com  \n\u25ba FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com \n\u25ba FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork \n\u25ba INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork \n\u25ba TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork \n\n#GuyFieri #DinersDriveInsAndDives #FoodNetwork #PastaalForno\n\nMaking Baked Pasta al Forno w/ Meatballs | Diners, Drive-ins and Dives with Guy Fieri | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/rQLzdDHMxVc"

Pour in the butter and continue to pulse until the crumbs are coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate. Set aside.\n\nFor the filling: In a small saucepan, heat the milk until hot but not simmering. To a medium saucepan, add the sugar, flour and cocoa and whisk together well. Lightly beat the egg yolks (saving the whites for the meringue) and pour into the flour mixture. Slowly add the hot milk, stirring. This will create a paste in the beginning, ensuring that the chocolate and flour blend smoothly. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until very thick, about 5 minutes. The mixture will start to bubble sporadically; continue to stir and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter, vanilla and salt. Stir until the butter is completely incorporated.\nPour the filling into the crust and chill in the refrigerator, about 45 minutes.\n\nFor the meringue: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the salt until stiff. With the mixer running, gradually add the sugar and beat until the whites are smooth and glossy. Spread the meringue on the pie, reaching the edges of the crust to seal in the filling. Bake until brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely before serving.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\n\u25ba FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN APP: http://foodtv.com/FNKApp \n\u25ba WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com  \n\u25ba FULL EPISODES: https://watch.foodnetwork.com \n\u25ba FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork \n\u25ba INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork \n\u25ba TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork \n\n#TrishasSouthernKitchen #TrishaYearwood #FoodNetwork #ChocolatePie\n\nTrisha Yearwood and Ree Drummond Bake Chocolate Pie | Trisha's Southern Kitchen | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/YyI-bG35shU",

Add cold water to cover by 2 inches (about 5 quarts). Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, until the chicken is very tender, for at least 1 1/2 hours (or up to 2 hours if you have the time. The longer the better!) Add more water, as needed, skimming off scum (there won\u2019t be much) and, if desired, some fat.\n\nCarefully strain the stock, discarding everything except for the chicken. (You should have 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 quarts of stock.) Set the chicken aside to cool briefly while you put together the rest of the soup. Return the strained stock to the pot and bring it to a simmer. Add the sliced carrot, sliced celery, chopped onion, sliced parsnip, chopped dill, chopped parsley and the salt. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, prepare the dumplings: In a small saucepan, bring the butter and 3/4 cup water to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour. Let cool for a few minutes so it\u2019s not so hot that it will cook the eggs, then whisk in the salt, sugar, nutmeg and the eggs, one at a time, until incorporated into a slightly lumpy thick batter. (It\u2019ll take a little work to whisk in the eggs.)\n\nDrop heaping teaspoons of the dumpling mixture into the simmering soup, then cover and cook until the vegetables are tender and the dumplings are cooked through; begin checking for doneness at 15 minutes.\n\nPull the chicken meat off the bones and chop into bite-sized pieces. Season it with salt, then add it to the soup along with the ground black pepper. Taste and add more salt as needed. This is important: The amount of salt in a chicken soup can mean the difference between unappetizing chicken tea and the elixir of bubble love that it should be. So don\u2019t skip this step, and don\u2019t rush it, either. Taste your soup, and if it doesn\u2019t make you smile reflexively, add more salt, about a 1/2 teaspoon of it, and give it a few good stirs so it can dissolve. Taste and repeat, as needed, until it tastes good.\n\nServe, garnishing with fresh parsley.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork \n\nMolly Yeh's Chicken and Dumpling Soup | Girl Meets Farm | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/i0tyVt6Aqy4",

We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nSpaghetti and Juicy Lucy Meatballs\nRECIPE COURTESY OF MOLLY YEH\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 1 hr 40 min\nActive: 1 hr\nYield: 4 to 6 servings\n\nIngredients\n\n1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning\n3 tablespoons (40 grams) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling\n1/2 large onion (5 1/2 ounces/160 grams), sliced \n5 garlic cloves, chopped \n1 teaspoon dried oregano \n1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes \nOne 28-ounce (794 grams) can whole plum or San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand \nOne 15-ounce (425 grams) can tomato sauce \n1 pound (453 grams) spaghetti \n1/4 cup (15 grams) fresh basil leaves, torn \n1/2 cup (40 grams) grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving \nMeatballs (recipe follows)\n\nMeatballs:\n\n1 pound (453 grams) 80/20 ground beef\n1 pound (453 grams) hot Italian sausage, removed from casings \n1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt \n2 large eggs, beaten \n1 cup (84 grams) plain dry breadcrumbs \n1 cup (40 grams) grated Parmesan cheese \n1/2 large onion (5 1/2 ounces/160 grams), grated on the coarse holes of a box grater \n1/4 cup (15 grams) chopped fresh Italian parsley \n2 garlic cloves, chopped \n8 small mozzarella balls/ciliegine (about 15 grams each) \n\nDirections\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat.\n\nFor the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, dried oregano and crushed red pepper and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add both types of canned tomatoes and 1 cup of water from the pasta pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer until thickened and flavorful, 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nOnce the meatballs are browned and the sauce has thickened, nestle the meatballs into the sauce and spoon a little of the sauce over each meatball. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer, cover and simmer while the pasta cooks, about 10 minutes.\n\nAdd the spaghetti to the boiling water and cook until al dente. Drain the spaghetti and place on a platter. Spoon some sauce onto the spaghetti and toss to coat. Nestle the cooked meatballs into the noodles. Top with desired amount of sauce, a drizzle of olive oil, the fresh basil and grated Parmesan cheese, for serving.\n\nMeatballs:\nYield: Makes 8 meatballs\n\nPlace an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nCombine the beef and sausage in a large bowl and spread out the meat with a wooden spoon. Season with salt. Add the eggs, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, onion, parsley and garlic in a large bowl and mix well with your hands to combine. Divide into 8 equal balls. Use your thumb to hollow out the center of a ball so it resembles a bowl. Stick a mozzarella ball inside and press to seal the mozzarella inside the meat mixture. Roll into a ball and place on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture and mozzarella.\n\nBake until the meatballs are well browned, 18 to 22 minutes. (They will cook more in the sauce).\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork \n\nMolly Yeh's Spaghetti and Juicy Lucy Meatballs | Girl Meets Farm | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/9cdILazfiiA",

Molly adds a Midwestern twist with her cheese-stuffed Juicy Lucy Meatballs, served with classic spaghetti and tomato sauce. \n#MollyYeh #GirlMeetsFarm #FoodNetwork #SpaghettiAndMeatballs\nWatch #GirlMeetsFarm Sundays @ 11a|10c and #StreamOnMax: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT!\nGet the recipe \u25b6 https://foodtv.com/3V839j4\nSubscribe to Food Network \u25b6 http://foodtv.com/YouTube\n\nCookbook author, food blogger and Midwest transplant Molly Yeh embraces her country life and makes dishes inspired by her Jewish and Chinese heritage \u2014 with a taste of the Midwest, too.\n\nWelcome to Food Network, where learning to cook is as simple as clicking play! Grab your apron and get ready to get cookin' with some of the best chefs around the world. We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nSpaghetti and Juicy Lucy Meatballs\nRECIPE COURTESY OF MOLLY YEH\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 1 hr 40 min\nActive: 1 hr\nYield: 4 to 6 servings\n\nIngredients\n\n1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning\n3 tablespoons (40 grams) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling\n1/2 large onion (5 1/2 ounces/160 grams), sliced \n5 garlic cloves, chopped \n1 teaspoon dried oregano \n1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes \nOne 28-ounce (794 grams) can whole plum or San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand \nOne 15-ounce (425 grams) can tomato sauce \n1 pound (453 grams) spaghetti \n1/4 cup (15 grams) fresh basil leaves, torn \n1/2 cup (40 grams) grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving \nMeatballs (recipe follows)\n\nMeatballs:\n\n1 pound (453 grams) 80/20 ground beef\n1 pound (453 grams) hot Italian sausage, removed from casings \n1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt \n2 large eggs, beaten \n1 cup (84 grams) plain dry breadcrumbs \n1 cup (40 grams) grated Parmesan cheese \n1/2 large onion (5 1/2 ounces/160 grams), grated on the coarse holes of a box grater \n1/4 cup (15 grams) chopped fresh Italian parsley \n2 garlic cloves, chopped \n8 small mozzarella balls/ciliegine (about 15 grams each) \n\nDirections\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat.\n\nFor the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, dried oregano and crushed red pepper and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add both types of canned tomatoes and 1 cup of water from the pasta pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer until thickened and flavorful, 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nOnce the meatballs are browned and the sauce has thickened, nestle the meatballs into the sauce and spoon a little of the sauce over each meatball. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer, cover and simmer while the pasta cooks, about 10 minutes.\n\nAdd the spaghetti to the boiling water and cook until al dente. Drain the spaghetti and place on a platter. Spoon some sauce onto the spaghetti and toss to coat. Nestle the cooked meatballs into the noodles. Top with desired amount of sauce, a drizzle of olive oil, the fresh basil and grated Parmesan cheese, for serving.\n\nMeatballs:\nYield: Makes 8 meatballs\n\nPlace an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nCombine the beef and sausage in a large bowl and spread out the meat with a wooden spoon. Season with salt. Add the eggs, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, onion, parsley and garlic in a large bowl and mix well with your hands to combine. Divide into 8 equal balls. Use your thumb to hollow out the center of a ball so it resembles a bowl. Stick a mozzarella ball inside and press to seal the mozzarella inside the meat mixture. Roll into a ball and place on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture and mozzarella.\n\nBake until the meatballs are well browned, 18 to 22 minutes. (They will cook more in the sauce).\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork \n\nMolly Yeh's Spaghetti and Juicy Lucy Meatballs | Girl Meets Farm | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/9cdILazfiiA"

It came back nationwide on Sunday, November 3. Emily and Herrine try the sandwich and compare it to the ones from other fast-food competitors including: Chick-fil-A, KFC, Wendy\u2019s, McDonald\u2019s, and Burger King. They also provide a quick summary of the Twitter war that fueled the internet frenzy. They ultimately decide if the Popeyes chicken sandwich is worth all the viral buzz and if it tastes better than its competitors\u2019.\n\nMORE BEST OF THE BEST:\nThe Best Hot Fried Chicken In Nashville https://youtu.be/uYaQ74Vqh5U\nThe Best Chicken Wings In Buffalo, NY https://youtu.be/2PMfDyMgBg4\nThe Best Deep Dish Pizza In Chicago https://youtu.be/X6fkP_5IHV0\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#PopeyesChicken #FastFood #FoodInsider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

It came back nationwide on Sunday, November 3. Emily and Herrine try the sandwich and compare it to the ones from other fast-food competitors including: Chick-fil-A, KFC, Wendy\u2019s, McDonald\u2019s, and Burger King. They also provide a quick summary of the Twitter war that fueled the internet frenzy. They ultimately decide if the Popeyes chicken sandwich is worth all the viral buzz and if it tastes better than its competitors\u2019.\n\nMORE BEST OF THE BEST:\nThe Best Hot Fried Chicken In Nashville https://youtu.be/uYaQ74Vqh5U\nThe Best Chicken Wings In Buffalo, NY https://youtu.be/2PMfDyMgBg4\nThe Best Deep Dish Pizza In Chicago https://youtu.be/X6fkP_5IHV0\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#PopeyesChicken #FastFood #FoodInsider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                    "description": "The Food Wars Team, Harry Kersh and Joe Avella, make McDonald\u2019s original recipe fries.\nWe\u2019ve spent weeks tracking down the original McDonald\u2019s fries recipe, recreating everything from the famous Formula 47 to the correct variety of potato, and we wanted to test this recipe against the modern McDonald\u2019s fries you\u2019re used to. \n\nMcDonalds\u2019s fries original 1955 recipe:\n\n2 large Idaho russet potatoes\n1/4 cup sugar\n2 tablespoons corn syrup\nformula 47 (6 cups beef tallow, \u00bd cup canola oil)\nsalt\nPeel the potatoes. In a large mixing bowl, combine sugar, corn syrup, and hot water. Make sure the sugar is dissolved. Cut the peeled potatoes into shoestrings. The potatoes should be 1/4\" x 1/4\" in thickness, and about 4\" to 6\" long. \nPlace the shoe-stringed potatoes into the bowl of sugar-water, and refrigerate. Let them soak for 30 minutes. While they're soaking, pack the shortening into the deep fryer. \nAfter it has liquefied and is at least 375\u00b0, drain the potatoes and place into the fryer. After 1 1/2 minutes, remove the potatoes and place them on a paper towel lined plate. Let them cool for 8 to 10 minutes in the refrigerator. \nAfter the deep fryer is reheated to 375\u00b0-400\u00b0, add the potatoes and deep fry again for 5-7 minutes until golden brown. Remove and place in a large bowl. Sprinkle generously with salt, then \"toss\" the fries to mix the salt evenly.\nDepending upon the size of the potatoes, this recipe makes about 2 medium sized fries. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:34 - The original 1955 recipe\n01:34 - Prep and cooking\n07:24 - Tasting original recipe\n08:57 - The new recipe\n10:46 - Beef flavoring taste test\n12:55 - Cooking new recipe\n14:20 - Tasting new recipe\n15:03 - Conclusion \n\nMORE FOOD INSIDER VIDEOS: \nMaking US Popcorn Chicken Using All 42 KFC Ingredients | Fast Food Chemistry\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRJkEw8ndQI\nUS vs Japan McDonald's | Food Wars\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLeYCwv0j9Q\nWhat McDonald\u2019s Menu Items Look Like Around The World\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJPmoHR7DlU\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#FastFoodChemistry #FoodWars #FoodInsider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                        "description": "The Food Wars Team, Harry Kersh and Joe Avella, make McDonald\u2019s original recipe fries.\nWe\u2019ve spent weeks tracking down the original McDonald\u2019s fries recipe, recreating everything from the famous Formula 47 to the correct variety of potato, and we wanted to test this recipe against the modern McDonald\u2019s fries you\u2019re used to. \n\nMcDonalds\u2019s fries original 1955 recipe:\n\n2 large Idaho russet potatoes\n1/4 cup sugar\n2 tablespoons corn syrup\nformula 47 (6 cups beef tallow, \u00bd cup canola oil)\nsalt\nPeel the potatoes. In a large mixing bowl, combine sugar, corn syrup, and hot water. Make sure the sugar is dissolved. Cut the peeled potatoes into shoestrings. The potatoes should be 1/4\" x 1/4\" in thickness, and about 4\" to 6\" long. \nPlace the shoe-stringed potatoes into the bowl of sugar-water, and refrigerate. Let them soak for 30 minutes. While they're soaking, pack the shortening into the deep fryer. \nAfter it has liquefied and is at least 375\u00b0, drain the potatoes and place into the fryer. After 1 1/2 minutes, remove the potatoes and place them on a paper towel lined plate. Let them cool for 8 to 10 minutes in the refrigerator. \nAfter the deep fryer is reheated to 375\u00b0-400\u00b0, add the potatoes and deep fry again for 5-7 minutes until golden brown. Remove and place in a large bowl. Sprinkle generously with salt, then \"toss\" the fries to mix the salt evenly.\nDepending upon the size of the potatoes, this recipe makes about 2 medium sized fries. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:34 - The original 1955 recipe\n01:34 - Prep and cooking\n07:24 - Tasting original recipe\n08:57 - The new recipe\n10:46 - Beef flavoring taste test\n12:55 - Cooking new recipe\n14:20 - Tasting new recipe\n15:03 - Conclusion \n\nMORE FOOD INSIDER VIDEOS: \nMaking US Popcorn Chicken Using All 42 KFC Ingredients | Fast Food Chemistry\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRJkEw8ndQI\nUS vs Japan McDonald's | Food Wars\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLeYCwv0j9Q\nWhat McDonald\u2019s Menu Items Look Like Around The World\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJPmoHR7DlU\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#FastFoodChemistry #FoodWars #FoodInsider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

Bubby\u2019s is famous for their brunch selections, including the sourdough pancakes, which uses a starter from 1890, and a more traditional stack topped with fried chicken (which is brined in-house for 24 hrs). Insider's Lisa Paradise traveled to Bubby\u2019s original location to talk with the owner Ron Silver, and find out what makes Bubby\u2019s pancakes unique.\n\nEditor's note: Insider visited Bubby's in February 2020.

We traveled to Yerevan, Armenia, to see how it's made there and learn about the importance of lavash. In Armenia, the dough is thinly rolled out and slapped against a tonir (underground clay oven) to bake for a few seconds. When fresh, it can be eaten with cheese or kebab, or on its own.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tsirani Garden Restaurant and the Megerian Cultural Complex: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/tsiranigarden.mbg/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MegerianCarpet/\n\nMORE REGIONAL EATS CONTENT:\nHow Italian Gorgonzola Cheese Is Made | Regional Eats\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPqK5LyGsiE\nHow Traditional Italian Olive Oil Is Made | Regional Eats\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCKUpFMmKJw\nHow A 100-Year-Old Vermont Creamery Makes Cheddar Cheese | Regional Eats\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sin87XMKm4E\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Lavash #Bread #FoodInsider\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                        "description": "Lavash, a traditional regional flatbread enjoyed around the South Caucasus and western Asia, is an essential part of Armenian, Iranian, and Turkish cuisine. We traveled to Yerevan, Armenia, to see how it's made there and learn about the importance of lavash. In Armenia, the dough is thinly rolled out and slapped against a tonir (underground clay oven) to bake for a few seconds. When fresh, it can be eaten with cheese or kebab, or on its own.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tsirani Garden Restaurant and the Megerian Cultural Complex: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/tsiranigarden.mbg/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MegerianCarpet/\n\nMORE REGIONAL EATS CONTENT:\nHow Italian Gorgonzola Cheese Is Made | Regional Eats\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPqK5LyGsiE\nHow Traditional Italian Olive Oil Is Made | Regional Eats\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCKUpFMmKJw\nHow A 100-Year-Old Vermont Creamery Makes Cheddar Cheese | Regional Eats\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sin87XMKm4E\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Lavash #Bread #FoodInsider\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

Bolivian Llama Party\u2019s location in Turnstyle may be overlooked by the average commuter. But for any determined New Yorker, Bolivian Llama Party\u2019s salte\u00f1as and chola sandwiches are well worth the hunt. \n\nSometimes called Bolivian soup dumplings, salte\u00f1as are best enjoyed by biting off the tip and slurping up all the delicious filling through the gap. We made the trek to Bolivian Llama Party via the subway to try out three kinds of salte\u00f1as and the best-selling chola Bolivian Llama Party offers. We talked to the three-brother team behind the restaurant about what it's like to run a restaurant inside of a subway station.\n\nMORE NY EATS CONTENT:\nHow This Father-Son Team Makes NYC's Most Legendary Mozzarella | Legendary Eats\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgAgvndqp24\nInside The Oldest Irish Tavern In NYC | Legendary Eats\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljdx4320tOA&\nPeruvian Restaurant In NYC Serves Anticuchos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcw8W0JosSY\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Bolivia #NYC #FoodInsider\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                        "description": "Underneath the 8th Avenue side of the Columbus Circle subway station lives an underground food hall known as Turnstyle. Bolivian Llama Party\u2019s location in Turnstyle may be overlooked by the average commuter. But for any determined New Yorker, Bolivian Llama Party\u2019s salte\u00f1as and chola sandwiches are well worth the hunt. \n\nSometimes called Bolivian soup dumplings, salte\u00f1as are best enjoyed by biting off the tip and slurping up all the delicious filling through the gap. We made the trek to Bolivian Llama Party via the subway to try out three kinds of salte\u00f1as and the best-selling chola Bolivian Llama Party offers. We talked to the three-brother team behind the restaurant about what it's like to run a restaurant inside of a subway station.\n\nMORE NY EATS CONTENT:\nHow This Father-Son Team Makes NYC's Most Legendary Mozzarella | Legendary Eats\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgAgvndqp24\nInside The Oldest Irish Tavern In NYC | Legendary Eats\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljdx4320tOA&\nPeruvian Restaurant In NYC Serves Anticuchos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcw8W0JosSY\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Bolivia #NYC #FoodInsider\n\nINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                    "description": "It's Ramsay Redemption Time and Monti Carlo is turning around what's either an audition for prison sentence or a dry meatloaf. Monti's turning around an awful Meatloaf dish and showing you how you can make it an easy gourmet delight! \n\nFollow Monti: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/themonticarlo/\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/themonticarlo \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheMontiCarlo/ \n\nIngredients\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n1 small onion, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n1 small carrot, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n1 stalk celery, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n1/4 cup chicken stock\n\n1/4 cup buttermilk\n\n\u00bc cup red wine\n\n1/2 cup ounces cremini mushrooms, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n2 cloves garlic,  chopped into a fine paste\n\n1 teaspoon fish sauce\n\n1 teaspoon soy sauce\n\n1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce\n\n\u00bc teaspoon paprika\n\n\u00bc teaspoon ground coriander\n\n\u00bc teaspoon ground cumin\n\n\u00bc teaspoon cayenne \n\n\u00bd cup panko\n\n1 lb f ground pork shoulder\n\n1 lb pounds ground chuck\n\n2 eggs\n\n1/4 cup parmesan, grated\n\n1/4 cup finely minced Italian parsley, more for garnish\n\n1 tablespoon kosher salt\n\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n\n\nFor the Glaze:\n\n3/4 cup ketchup\n\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n\n1 teaspoon worcestershire  sauce\n\n2  teaspoons tabasco \n\n1 tablespoon honey\n\n1/4 cup white vinegar\n\n\u00bd teaspoon black pepper\n\n\nDirections\n\nSTEP 1\n\nIn a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sautee the onions with a generous pinch of salt until they are translucent. Add the carrot and celery and another generous pinch of salt. Continue to cook until the mixture starts to turn golden.\n\n\nSTEP 2\n\nAdd the garlic paste, paprika, cayenne, cumin, coriander, and mushrooms. Cook until the garlic starts to bloom.\n\n\nSTEP 3\n\nAdd the fish sauce, soy sauce, buttermilk, wine, and chicken stock. Cook until the liquid has reduced by half. \n\n\nSTEP 4\n\nStir in the panko and let the mixture cool. \n\n\nSTEP 5\n\nAdd the beef and pork to the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Mix gently on low for about 20 seconds until combined. Add the eggs, parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix gently on low until combined. Test a small bit of the beef mixture for seasoning. Cook it in a pan for a minute, taste, and adjust the seasoning as needed.\n\n\nSTEP 6\n\nTransfer the mixture to a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan. Work out any air bubbles by slamming the pan down a few times. Use a bamboo skewer to puncture the loaf a few times all the way to the bottom of the pan. This creates an escape route for any additional air bubbles. Wrap the pan in a sheet of aluminum foil big enough to cover a sheet pan and let the loaf rest in the fridge for 15 minutes. \n\n\nSTEP 7\n\nPreheat your oven to 350, with the rack in the center. When your oven is at temp, take your loaf and invert it onto a rimmed baking sheet (the top of the load should be on the sheet). Loosen the foil around the loaf pan, spread it out, then fold up the edges to trap the meatloaf\u2019s juices. \n\n\nSTEP 8\n\nBake for 30 minutes. Use a metal spatula to lift an edge of the pan off the loaf. The loaf should be set. If it is, take the sheet pan out of the oven and take the loaf pan off the loaf using oven mitts. Continue to bake the meatloaf until 140\u00b0F. \n\n\nSTEP 9\n\nRemove from the loaf from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes. Set the oven on broil.\n\nMeanwhile, in a small pan combine the ketchup, tomato paste, honey, vinegar, worcestershire sauce, and pepper and bring to a simmer.\n\n\nSTEP 10\n\nBrush a thin layer of the glaze on the meatloaf. Put it back in the oven and bake for 4 minutes. Glaze it again and bake until the glaze has turned a deep brown, about 4 minutes more. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice and serve with any extra glaze. Garnish with fresh chopped Italian Parsley.",

                        "description": "It's Ramsay Redemption Time and Monti Carlo is turning around what's either an audition for prison sentence or a dry meatloaf. Monti's turning around an awful Meatloaf dish and showing you how you can make it an easy gourmet delight! \n\nFollow Monti: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/themonticarlo/\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/themonticarlo \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheMontiCarlo/ \n\nIngredients\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n1 small onion, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n1 small carrot, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n1 stalk celery, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n1/4 cup chicken stock\n\n1/4 cup buttermilk\n\n\u00bc cup red wine\n\n1/2 cup ounces cremini mushrooms, fine dice (by hand or in food pro)\n\n2 cloves garlic,  chopped into a fine paste\n\n1 teaspoon fish sauce\n\n1 teaspoon soy sauce\n\n1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce\n\n\u00bc teaspoon paprika\n\n\u00bc teaspoon ground coriander\n\n\u00bc teaspoon ground cumin\n\n\u00bc teaspoon cayenne \n\n\u00bd cup panko\n\n1 lb f ground pork shoulder\n\n1 lb pounds ground chuck\n\n2 eggs\n\n1/4 cup parmesan, grated\n\n1/4 cup finely minced Italian parsley, more for garnish\n\n1 tablespoon kosher salt\n\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n\n\nFor the Glaze:\n\n3/4 cup ketchup\n\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n\n1 teaspoon worcestershire  sauce\n\n2  teaspoons tabasco \n\n1 tablespoon honey\n\n1/4 cup white vinegar\n\n\u00bd teaspoon black pepper\n\n\nDirections\n\nSTEP 1\n\nIn a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sautee the onions with a generous pinch of salt until they are translucent. Add the carrot and celery and another generous pinch of salt. Continue to cook until the mixture starts to turn golden.\n\n\nSTEP 2\n\nAdd the garlic paste, paprika, cayenne, cumin, coriander, and mushrooms. Cook until the garlic starts to bloom.\n\n\nSTEP 3\n\nAdd the fish sauce, soy sauce, buttermilk, wine, and chicken stock. Cook until the liquid has reduced by half. \n\n\nSTEP 4\n\nStir in the panko and let the mixture cool. \n\n\nSTEP 5\n\nAdd the beef and pork to the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Mix gently on low for about 20 seconds until combined. Add the eggs, parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix gently on low until combined. Test a small bit of the beef mixture for seasoning. Cook it in a pan for a minute, taste, and adjust the seasoning as needed.\n\n\nSTEP 6\n\nTransfer the mixture to a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan. Work out any air bubbles by slamming the pan down a few times. Use a bamboo skewer to puncture the loaf a few times all the way to the bottom of the pan. This creates an escape route for any additional air bubbles. Wrap the pan in a sheet of aluminum foil big enough to cover a sheet pan and let the loaf rest in the fridge for 15 minutes. \n\n\nSTEP 7\n\nPreheat your oven to 350, with the rack in the center. When your oven is at temp, take your loaf and invert it onto a rimmed baking sheet (the top of the load should be on the sheet). Loosen the foil around the loaf pan, spread it out, then fold up the edges to trap the meatloaf\u2019s juices. \n\n\nSTEP 8\n\nBake for 30 minutes. Use a metal spatula to lift an edge of the pan off the loaf. The loaf should be set. If it is, take the sheet pan out of the oven and take the loaf pan off the loaf using oven mitts. Continue to bake the meatloaf until 140\u00b0F. \n\n\nSTEP 9\n\nRemove from the loaf from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes. Set the oven on broil.\n\nMeanwhile, in a small pan combine the ketchup, tomato paste, honey, vinegar, worcestershire sauce, and pepper and bring to a simmer.\n\n\nSTEP 10\n\nBrush a thin layer of the glaze on the meatloaf. Put it back in the oven and bake for 4 minutes. Glaze it again and bake until the glaze has turned a deep brown, about 4 minutes more. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice and serve with any extra glaze. Garnish with fresh chopped Italian Parsley."

How will the this Southern Spin turn out? \n\nFollow Monti: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/themonticarlo/\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/themonticarlo \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheMontiCarlo/ \n\nRecipe: \nDIRECTIONS\nStep 1\n\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0 and line a sheet pan with parchment paper.\n\nIn a pint size mason jar, mix the vinegar into the heavy cream and seal\n\n Shake it for 1 minute straight until it thickens. Congrats! You just made sour cream!\n\nStep 2\n\nGrate frozen butter in a food processor. \n\nToss together grated butter,  flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. \n\nChill in the freezer for 10 minutes.\n\n\nStep 3\n\nTake the flour and butter mixture out of the freezer and make a well in the middle.\n\nAdd the sour cream and mix JUST until a dough forms. You want a sticky, wet dough. If the dough is too dry, add a few more tablespoons of heavy cream.\n\n\nStep 4\n\nLightly flour your work surface and put your dough on it. \n\nSprinkle flour over the top of the dough.\n\nLightly flour your rolling pin and roll the dough into a 9X5-inch rectangle that is about 1 inch thick. The shortest sides of the rectangle should be the left and right sides.\n\nFold the dough over each other in thirds, like a business letter.  Roll the dough lightly again into a 9 x 5-inch rectangle and repeat the letter fold 5 times total. \n\nCover the dough with plastic wrap and let it firm up in the fridge.\n\n\nStep 5\n\nRoll the dough out lightly until it is \u00bd an inch thick. \n\nDip a 2 1/2-inch round cutter into flour, and punch straight down. \n\nRe-roll scraps, and make more rounds.\n\nLine the rounds up on your sheet pan so their sides touch.\n\nBrush the tops with a touch of heavy cream.\n\n\nStep 6\n\nBake for 10 to 15 minutes, until they are a golden brown. \n\nBrush the tops with melted butter.\n\n\nTIPS FOR BISCUIT PERFECTION\n\n\n#1 KEEP IT COLD\n\nBiscuit dough is just like revenge. It\u2019s a dish best served cold.\n\nKeep your bowl and the flour in the fridge until just before mixing. Keep the butter in the freezer until it\u2019s time to grate it into the flour. \n\n\n#2 DONT MESS WITH IT TOO MUCH\n\nWhen you mix the ingredients together, do it with the least amount of stirring possible to keep gluten from forming. That way when people bite into the biscuit, they don\u2019t chip a tooth. Ain\u2019t nobody got time for that.\n\n\n#3 MAKE IT FLAKY\n\nBeing a flake is bad for internet dating but AMAZING for biscuits. \n\nTo get the flakiest biscuits ever, roll the dough out gently without pressing down too much. Your hands are hot, keep them away from the dough.\n\n\n#4 DONT GET IT TWISTED\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to cut your biscuits, dip the cutter in flour so it doesn\u2019t stick to the dough. Then punch straight down, DON\u2019T TWIST.  Twisting dough keeps it from rising.\n\n\n#5 TOGETHER WE RISE\n\nPut the biscuits on your sheet pan so their sides touch. They help each other rise.\n\n\n\nGRAVY\nTOOLS\nLarge, heavy-bottomed saucepan (rounded sides)\n\nWooden Spoon with a flat edge\n\nSlotted Spoon\n\nWhisk\n\n\nINGREDIENTS\n12 ounces pork sausage\n\n3 tablespoons all-purpose flour \n\n2 cups whole milk\n\nSalt TT\n\nBlack Pepper TT\n\nChives, sliced on the bias for garnish\n\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nStep 1\n\nPlace a large saucepan over medium-high heat.\n\nChop up the sausage into small dice. \n\nBrown the sausage. Don\u2019t stir it too much. The brown stuff stuck to the pan is called fond and that\u2019s exactly how you should feel about it. It\u2019s a flavor gold mine!\n\nOnce the sausage has cooked through, remove it from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n\n\nStep 2\n\nLower the heat to medium and scrape the bottom of the pan with the flat edge of a wooden spoon to remove all the brown spots. \n\nSprinkle in the flour. \n\nWhisk until the flour has soaked into the fat and continue to cook until you can no longer smell raw flour (about 1 minute).\n\n\nStep 3\n\nAdd the milk to the pan in a small stream, whisking constantly. Don\u2019t stop stirring until the gravy thickens, about 5 to 7 minutes. Work your whisk into the round sides of the saucepan to unearth any trapped flour and keep the gravy from getting lumpy.\n\nWhen the gravy is thick and glossy, add the sausage back into it and stir to incorporate. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the gravy has thickened too much, thin it with a little milk, until it\u2019s the right consistency.\n\n\nTO SERVE\nSlice biscuits in half and place the biscuit bottom on the center of a plate. \n\nPour about \u2153 cup of gravy on the top. \n\nGarnish the gravy with sliced chives. \n\nLean the biscuit top over the gravy at an angle.",
