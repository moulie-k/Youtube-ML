These individuals aren\u2019t just the stars of the show: they\u2019re writers, directors, and crisis managers. While they are everything from charming to difficult, inspiring to insecure, and even downright eccentric, their genius shines bright when they consistently make it all look so easy - five nights a week, every week!\n\nProduced by CNN Audio and Cream Productions\nHosted by Bill Carter\n\nSubscribe to Behind the Desk: The Story of Late Night: https://cnn.it/3AmivVW\n\nDiscover more of our podcasts at https://cnn.com/podcasts\n\n#CNN #TheStoryOfLateNight #Podcast"

                    "description": "A global technology outage grounded flights, knocked banks and hospital systems offline and media outlets off air on Friday in a massive disruption that affected companies and services around the world and highlighted dependence on software from a handful of providers.\n\nCyber expert James Bore explained the situation and said real harm would be caused by the outage because systems we\u2019ve come to rely on at critical times are not going to be available.\n\n\"This is going to take some time to fix, and this is the type of thing that is absolutely inevitable with the way that technology now works,\" he told the AP.\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said that the issue believed to be behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack \u2014 and that a fix was on the way. The company said the problem occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows.\n\nBut hours after the problem was first detected, the disarray continued \u2014 and escalated.\n\nLong lines formed at airports in the U.S., Europe and Asia as airlines lost access to check-in and booking services at a time when many travelers are heading away on summer vacations. News outlets in Australia \u2014 where telecommunications were severely affected \u2014 were pushed off air for hours.\n\nHospitals and doctor's offices had problems with their appointment systems, while banks in South Africa and New Zealand reported outages to their payment system or websites and apps.\n\n\n#microsoft #microsoftnews #microsoftoutage #flight #stcokexchange #indiatoday #indiatodaynews \n\n\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

                        "description": "A global technology outage grounded flights, knocked banks and hospital systems offline and media outlets off air on Friday in a massive disruption that affected companies and services around the world and highlighted dependence on software from a handful of providers.\n\nCyber expert James Bore explained the situation and said real harm would be caused by the outage because systems we\u2019ve come to rely on at critical times are not going to be available.\n\n\"This is going to take some time to fix, and this is the type of thing that is absolutely inevitable with the way that technology now works,\" he told the AP.\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said that the issue believed to be behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack \u2014 and that a fix was on the way. The company said the problem occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows.\n\nBut hours after the problem was first detected, the disarray continued \u2014 and escalated.\n\nLong lines formed at airports in the U.S., Europe and Asia as airlines lost access to check-in and booking services at a time when many travelers are heading away on summer vacations. News outlets in Australia \u2014 where telecommunications were severely affected \u2014 were pushed off air for hours.\n\nHospitals and doctor's offices had problems with their appointment systems, while banks in South Africa and New Zealand reported outages to their payment system or websites and apps.\n\n\n#microsoft #microsoftnews #microsoftoutage #flight #stcokexchange #indiatoday #indiatodaynews \n\n\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

                    "description": "India ended its campaign with six medals, pending Vinesh Phogat\u2019s verdict, in the Paris Olympics. After achieving their best-ever tally of six medals at the Tokyo Olympics, India fell short of that mark by one medal in Paris.\n\nYes, India did not win a Gold medal and finished 71st on the rankings, even behind Pakistan. However, considering as many as six fourth-place finishes, India can be proud of what they have achieved.\n\nWhile badminton stars and boxing heroes failed to live up to the hype, India did well in shooting, bringing back glory days and ending an 8-year drought. Wrestling contingent proved beyond doubt that it will remain one of the most productive sports for India at the Games.\n\nThe track and field contingent disappointed, but it\u2019s not fair to expect a lot from them, considering the difference in support systems for our athletes and those in the big medal-winning nations.\n\nStop being judgemental. Yes, question the athletes for not winning medals, question the system. But, be fair and be respectful towards India\u2019s Olympians.\n\nIn the latest episode of the Olympic tales, Akshay Ramesh, Kingshuk Kusari and Alan John discuss India\u2019s Paris Olympics 2024.\n\nWatch!\n\nProduced by Anna Priyadarshini\n \n\nYou can also tune in here:\n \n \nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6cmziLOjlHLlur13YqmtEf\n \n \nApple Podcasts:  https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fashion-scoop/id1728808543\n \n \nClick here for the latest podcast: https://podcasts.indiatoday.in/\n \n \nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IndiaTodayPodcasts\n \n \nFollow us on Twitter: https://x.com/IndiaTodayPods\n                        Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/indiatodaypodcasts/\n\n #Olympics #Olympics2024 #ParisOlympics #ParisOlympics2024 #France #Podcasts #OlympicTales #IndiaAtOlympics #OlympicsPodcast #IndianAthletes #OlympicGames #Badminton #VineshPhogat  #Wrestling #vineshphogatnews #vineshphogatmatch #vineshphogatdisqualified  #parisolympicslive #indiatoday #NeerajChopra #Javelin #JavelinThrow #Hockey #Silver #Bronze #PRSreejesh #ArshadNadeem #Pakistan #ManuBhaker\n\n\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

                        "description": "India ended its campaign with six medals, pending Vinesh Phogat\u2019s verdict, in the Paris Olympics. After achieving their best-ever tally of six medals at the Tokyo Olympics, India fell short of that mark by one medal in Paris.\n\nYes, India did not win a Gold medal and finished 71st on the rankings, even behind Pakistan. However, considering as many as six fourth-place finishes, India can be proud of what they have achieved.\n\nWhile badminton stars and boxing heroes failed to live up to the hype, India did well in shooting, bringing back glory days and ending an 8-year drought. Wrestling contingent proved beyond doubt that it will remain one of the most productive sports for India at the Games.\n\nThe track and field contingent disappointed, but it\u2019s not fair to expect a lot from them, considering the difference in support systems for our athletes and those in the big medal-winning nations.\n\nStop being judgemental. Yes, question the athletes for not winning medals, question the system. But, be fair and be respectful towards India\u2019s Olympians.\n\nIn the latest episode of the Olympic tales, Akshay Ramesh, Kingshuk Kusari and Alan John discuss India\u2019s Paris Olympics 2024.\n\nWatch!\n\nProduced by Anna Priyadarshini\n \n\nYou can also tune in here:\n \n \nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6cmziLOjlHLlur13YqmtEf\n \n \nApple Podcasts:  https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fashion-scoop/id1728808543\n \n \nClick here for the latest podcast: https://podcasts.indiatoday.in/\n \n \nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IndiaTodayPodcasts\n \n \nFollow us on Twitter: https://x.com/IndiaTodayPods\n                        Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/indiatodaypodcasts/\n\n #Olympics #Olympics2024 #ParisOlympics #ParisOlympics2024 #France #Podcasts #OlympicTales #IndiaAtOlympics #OlympicsPodcast #IndianAthletes #OlympicGames #Badminton #VineshPhogat  #Wrestling #vineshphogatnews #vineshphogatmatch #vineshphogatdisqualified  #parisolympicslive #indiatoday #NeerajChopra #Javelin #JavelinThrow #Hockey #Silver #Bronze #PRSreejesh #ArshadNadeem #Pakistan #ManuBhaker\n\n\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

It was an epic India vs Pakistan duel at the Olympics and it promises to become bigger and bigger in the coming years.\n\nNeeraj Chopra was favourite to win gold medal in the men's javelin final in Paris. However, Arshad Nadeem stunned the field with an Olympic record throw of 92.97m. Neeraj came close to breaching the 90m-mark, but it was not enough.\n\nWhile India celebrated Neeraj Chopra's historic silver medal, there were bittersweet feelings too. Indian sports fans were not used to seeing Neeraj finish second-best often.\n\nNeeraj Chopra has promised to improve. He conceded that breaching 90m is a necessity.\n\nHowever, it was Arshad Nadeem's day as he stole the thunder at Stade de France in Paris. With limited support and facilities back home, Neeraj became Pakistan's first-ever track and field Olympic gold medalist.\n\nThe reactions in both countries was heartwarming. Neeraj Chopra's mother won hearts when she dismissed hate and said 'the guy who won gold is also our child'.\n\nAkshay Ramesh and Saurabh Kumar discuss the sensational men's javelin final at the Olympics.\n\nWatch!\n\nProduced by Anna Priyadarshini\n \n\nYou can also tune in here:\n \n \nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6cmziLOjlHLlur13YqmtEf\n \n \nApple Podcasts:  https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fashion-scoop/id1728808543\n \n \nClick here for the latest podcast: https://podcasts.indiatoday.in/\n \n \nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IndiaTodayPodcasts\n \n \nFollow us on Twitter: https://x.com/IndiaTodayPods\n                        Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/indiatodaypodcasts/\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video. \n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button! \n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

This significant event marks a new chapter in the representation of the Indian community in British politics. Shivani Raja's victory in Leicester East is especially noteworthy as it ends the Labour Party's 37-year dominance in the constituency. Her triumph, defeating Rajesh Agrawal with 14,526 votes, is a testament to her strong campaign and the support she garnered from the community.

Narendra Modi took the oath as the Prime Minister for the third straight term with 71 ministers in his Union council on Sunday.

                    "description": "Iran launched around 300 drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria earlier this month. The attack lasted for five hours and 99 per cent of drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel. The Israeli military said that it was on high alert and monitoring all targets. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened the Israeli war cabinet at military headquarters in Tel Aviv after Iran's attack. Meanwhile, the US said it stood by Israel and will \"support their defence\". In response, Iran's mission to the United Nations said the US must stay away from the conflict between Iran and Israel and warned that Tehran's response would be more severe if Israel retaliates.

                    "description": "Hunter Biden has been found guilty on all three charges in his federal gun trial, becoming the first son of a sitting US president to be receive a criminal conviction.\n\nProsecutors said Biden, 54, had lied about his drug use  on a federal form when he bought a handgun in 2018.\n\nBiden pleaded not guilty, claiming he was in recovery from drug addiction at the time and therefore did not lie on the gun application form.\n\nA panel of 12 Delaware jurors reached their verdict after about three hours of deliberations. Biden showed little emotion as he learned his fate. He stared ahead with arms folded before turning around to hug some of the associates on his legal team.\n\nHe faced two charges related to lying about his drug use on a federal background check, and one for possessing a gun while addicted to or using drugs.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

                        "description": "Hunter Biden has been found guilty on all three charges in his federal gun trial, becoming the first son of a sitting US president to be receive a criminal conviction.\n\nProsecutors said Biden, 54, had lied about his drug use  on a federal form when he bought a handgun in 2018.\n\nBiden pleaded not guilty, claiming he was in recovery from drug addiction at the time and therefore did not lie on the gun application form.\n\nA panel of 12 Delaware jurors reached their verdict after about three hours of deliberations. Biden showed little emotion as he learned his fate. He stared ahead with arms folded before turning around to hug some of the associates on his legal team.\n\nHe faced two charges related to lying about his drug use on a federal background check, and one for possessing a gun while addicted to or using drugs.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

                    "description": "Boris Johnson has apologised, at the UK\u2019s official inquiry into the Covid pandemic, for the way his government handled the crisis.   The former Prime Minister said it had \"vastly underestimated\" the threat posed by the virus.\n\nMr Johnson admitted that as Prime Minister he should have realised sooner how serious the crisis was. He said he was sorry for the pain, loss and suffering of victims and families. \n\nMr Johnson has been accused of lying about government decisions during the pandemic.   It's accused of failing to protect elderly people in care homes.  The UK suffered one of the highest death rates from Covid in western Europe.\n\nMr Johnson was forced to resign as Prime Minister after it emerged that parties had been held in Downing Street in breach of the government\u2019s Covid restrictions. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Vicki Young and Hugh Pym\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

                        "description": "Boris Johnson has apologised, at the UK\u2019s official inquiry into the Covid pandemic, for the way his government handled the crisis.   The former Prime Minister said it had \"vastly underestimated\" the threat posed by the virus.\n\nMr Johnson admitted that as Prime Minister he should have realised sooner how serious the crisis was. He said he was sorry for the pain, loss and suffering of victims and families. \n\nMr Johnson has been accused of lying about government decisions during the pandemic.   It's accused of failing to protect elderly people in care homes.  The UK suffered one of the highest death rates from Covid in western Europe.\n\nMr Johnson was forced to resign as Prime Minister after it emerged that parties had been held in Downing Street in breach of the government\u2019s Covid restrictions. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Vicki Young and Hugh Pym\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

Refugees and migrants filming on mobile phones reveal how vulnerable people have to share taps and toilets with those who have tested positive for the virus, risking onward transmission. Strict quarantine is enforced on camps where coronavirus cases are confirmed, leading to some shortages in food, water and medical care inside. Fear of the virus and anger at camp conditions have led to violence. Panorama hears from charity and public health experts who warn that any failure to control the spread of the virus inside the camps could lead to potentially dangerous outbreaks.",

                    "description": "Doctors in India have begun a national strike, escalating the protest against the rape and murder of a female colleague in the West Bengal city of Kolkata.\n\nThe Indian Medical Association (IMA), the country's largest grouping of doctors, said all non-essential hospital services would be shut down across the country on Saturday.\n\nThe IMA described last week's killing as a \"crime of barbaric scale due to the lack of safe spaces for women\" and asked for the country's support in its \"struggle for justice\".\n\nProtests against the attack and calling for the better protection of women have intensified in recent days after a mob vandalised the hospital where it happened.\n\nIn a statement, the IMA said emergency and casualty services would continue to run and that the strike would last for 24 hours.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#India #BBCNews",

                        "description": "Doctors in India have begun a national strike, escalating the protest against the rape and murder of a female colleague in the West Bengal city of Kolkata.\n\nThe Indian Medical Association (IMA), the country's largest grouping of doctors, said all non-essential hospital services would be shut down across the country on Saturday.\n\nThe IMA described last week's killing as a \"crime of barbaric scale due to the lack of safe spaces for women\" and asked for the country's support in its \"struggle for justice\".\n\nProtests against the attack and calling for the better protection of women have intensified in recent days after a mob vandalised the hospital where it happened.\n\nIn a statement, the IMA said emergency and casualty services would continue to run and that the strike would last for 24 hours.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#India #BBCNews"

Kenyan police, left red-faced after the escape, have arrested eight of their own officers and have launched a manhunt to catch the escapee they describe as a \"vampire\" and \"psychopath\". The accused broke out from a Nairobi prison cell along with 12 others on Tuesday. Jumaisi had been held at the police station since his arrest in July after the discovery of 10 mutilated female bodies in a dumpsite in the Nairobi slum of Mukuru. The brutal murders sparked shock and outrage in Kenya. The case also brought the role of the Kenyan police in the spotlight, as the bodies were found just 100 meters away from a police station.

We are live from Durban, South Africa.\n\nNigerian President Bola Tinubu is facing outrage over the government's purchase of a new presidential jet. Bola Tinubu flew to Paris on August 19 on a newly purchased Airbus A330, which replaces a 19-year-old Boeing 737-700 jet in the president's fleet. However, buying a plane jet comes at a time when Nigeria is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a generation. Social media users in Nigeria called the president insensitive to the plight of average Nigerians. The purchase also comes less than a fortnight after thousands took to the streets across the country, protesting against the rising cost of living. But the president's office has defended the purchase of a new aircraft.\n\nAlso on the show:\n\n- Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger Write To UN Demanding Action Against Ukraine\n- Niger Resumes Oil Exports Through Benin After Months-Long Dispute\n- Sudanese Female Mechanic Smashes Patriarchy In Libya\n\n---\n\nNigeria | Nigerian President | Bola Tinubu | Plane | Economic Woes | Firstpost Africa | Alyson Le Grange | Africa | Global South | Geopolitics | Military Coup | Environment | Climate Change | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#nigeria #bolatinubu #plane #firstpostafrica #africa #alysonlegrange #globalsouth #militarycoup #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

                        "description": "LIVE: Anger Over Nigerian President Tinubu's Plane Purchase Amid Economic Woes | Firstpost Africa\n\nWelcome to Firstpost Africa with Alyson Le Grange. We are live from Durban, South Africa.\n\nNigerian President Bola Tinubu is facing outrage over the government's purchase of a new presidential jet. Bola Tinubu flew to Paris on August 19 on a newly purchased Airbus A330, which replaces a 19-year-old Boeing 737-700 jet in the president's fleet. However, buying a plane jet comes at a time when Nigeria is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a generation. Social media users in Nigeria called the president insensitive to the plight of average Nigerians. The purchase also comes less than a fortnight after thousands took to the streets across the country, protesting against the rising cost of living. But the president's office has defended the purchase of a new aircraft.\n\nAlso on the show:\n\n- Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger Write To UN Demanding Action Against Ukraine\n- Niger Resumes Oil Exports Through Benin After Months-Long Dispute\n- Sudanese Female Mechanic Smashes Patriarchy In Libya\n\n---\n\nNigeria | Nigerian President | Bola Tinubu | Plane | Economic Woes | Firstpost Africa | Alyson Le Grange | Africa | Global South | Geopolitics | Military Coup | Environment | Climate Change | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#nigeria #bolatinubu #plane #firstpostafrica #africa #alysonlegrange #globalsouth #militarycoup #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

Despite the company's green initiatives, Niccol will commute daily from California to Seattle via private jet, raising questions about Starbucks' true commitment to sustainability.\n\n---\n\nDonald Trump | North Carolina | Trump Assassination Attempt | US Elections 2024 | JD Vance | Firstpost America | Eric Ham | War | Geopolitics | Global Economy | Firstpost | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | Trending News\n\n#donaldtrump #northcarolina #trumpassassinationattempt #uselections2024 #jdvance #firstpostamerica #ericham #war #geopolitics #economy #firstpost #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

                    "description": "How REITs Provide a More Affordable Way to Invest in Real Estate\n\nAs the world reels under the pressure of high interest rates and rising inflation, it has increasingly become impossible for many to buy a house. In this context, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) have emerged as a new investment alternative to direct property investment. REITs are companies that own or operate properties and are traded like stocks on exchanges. They generate returns through rental income, interest from property loans, and capital appreciation. REITs provide access to real estate investment without the need for large capital, offering dividends and potential price growth. Globally, REITs have grown from 120 in 1990 to 940 across 40 countries by 2023, with a market value of $2 trillion. Reports indicate that India's REIT market has become the fastest-growing in Asia-Pacific, offering promising investment opportunities in commercial real estate. The market, which was initiated by Blackstone and Embassy Group-backed REITs, is now attracting more global investors.\n\n---\n\nReal Estate | Economy | Real Estate Investment Trusts | REITs | Capital Gains | Stocks | Equity | Blackstone | Hindenburg Research | SEBI | Madhabi Puri Buch | India | Stock Market | Short-selling | Sensex | Nifty | Stock Manipulation | Stock Exchange Board of India | SEBI Chief | Dhaval Buch | SEBI Chairperson | Gautam Adani | Adani Group | Adani Stocks | Hindenburg Research Report | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#reitinvesting #investment #realestate #hindenburgreport #hindenburgresearch #adani #hindenburg #adanigroup #sebi #madhabipuribuch  #hindenburgreportonadani #hindenberg #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

Ten police officers have been injured and one person arrested during disorder in Londonderry, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said. Petrol bombs, fireworks and stones were thrown by nationalist youths at police lines during trouble in Nailors Row on Saturday evening. Reportedly, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has cancelled a planned holiday to focus on his government's response to a series of racist riots that targeted Muslims and migrants. Thousands of police officers remained on duty over the weekend in case violence flared again although for a fourth day in a row on Saturday counter-protesters far outnumbered anti-migration demonstrators in several towns and cities. \n\n---\n\nUK | Anti-Racism Protest | Anti-Immigration Protest | UK Riots | UK Violence | Muslims | Migrants | Keir Starmer | Migrant Crisis | UK Stabbing | Southport Stabbing | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#uk #ukriots #ukprotests #ukmigration #muslims #migrants #attack #ukviolence #southport #southportstabbing #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

Ten police officers have been injured and one person arrested during disorder in Londonderry, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said. Petrol bombs, fireworks and stones were thrown by nationalist youths at police lines during trouble in Nailors Row on Saturday evening. Reportedly, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has cancelled a planned holiday to focus on his government's response to a series of racist riots that targeted Muslims and migrants. Thousands of police officers remained on duty over the weekend in case violence flared again although for a fourth day in a row on Saturday counter-protesters far outnumbered anti-migration demonstrators in several towns and cities. \n\n---\n\nUK | Anti-Racism Protest | Anti-Immigration Protest | UK Riots | UK Violence | Muslims | Migrants | Keir Starmer | Migrant Crisis | UK Stabbing | Southport Stabbing | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#uk #ukriots #ukprotests #ukmigration #muslims #migrants #attack #ukviolence #southport #southportstabbing #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

Wade at DNC 2024\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris and her vice presidential pick, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, took to the Milwaukee stage on Tuesday (August 20) in the same venue as last month's Republican National Convention, where Trump formally received his party's nod. In her speech, Harris criticized Trump for saying he had no regrets about the US Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had recognized women's constitutional right to abortion. Three Trump-appointed justices joined a 6-3 majority on the high court. \"We will make sure he does face a consequence and that will be at the ballot box in November,\" Harris said. Democrats see abortion rights as a winning issue in this campaign and Harris had led the charge as vice president.\n\n---\n\nKamala Harris | Milwaukee | US Elections 2024 | Tim Walz | Economic Vision | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#uselections2024 #kamalaharris #timwalz #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

Wade at DNC 2024\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris and her vice presidential pick, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, took to the Milwaukee stage on Tuesday (August 20) in the same venue as last month's Republican National Convention, where Trump formally received his party's nod. In her speech, Harris criticized Trump for saying he had no regrets about the US Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had recognized women's constitutional right to abortion. Three Trump-appointed justices joined a 6-3 majority on the high court. \"We will make sure he does face a consequence and that will be at the ballot box in November,\" Harris said. Democrats see abortion rights as a winning issue in this campaign and Harris had led the charge as vice president.\n\n---\n\nKamala Harris | Milwaukee | US Elections 2024 | Tim Walz | Economic Vision | Firstpost | News Live | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | News | Trending News\n\n#uselections2024 #kamalaharris #timwalz #firstpost #newslive #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #news #internationalnews #trendingnews\n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.

Although the situation has improved significantly since Friday's chaotic scenes, passengers continue to face challenges, particularly at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI).\n\nAt Delhi's IGI Airport's Terminal 3, passengers experienced some improvement today, but a few problems persist.
