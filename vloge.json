Say yes to invitations to a new country, say yes to meet new friends, say yes to learning a new language, picking up a new sport. Yes is how you get your first job, and your next job, and your spouse, and even your kids. Even if it's a bit edgy, a bit out of your comfort zone, saying yes means that you will do something new, meet someone new, and make a difference in your life. Yes lets you stand out in a crowd, be the optimist, to stay positive, be the one everyone comes to. Yes is what keeps us all young.\" \n-Eric Schmidt\n\nGo make someone smile, go for an adventure, go try something new!\nLet me know how it goes!

Here's some more information:\n\n\"Calanques are essentially inlets that are formed by glaciers. Many times, they are partially submerged in the ocean and are formed out of limestone. These geologic formations are notable for typically having steep sides. The calanques in Marseille and Cassis are the most famous examples of these kinds of beautiful formations, which can also be considered fjords of the Mediterranean variety. Visitors of Marseille will not only be able to enjoy the beaches, deltas, and charming coastal towns, but also the miles of rugged calanques that stretch between Marseille and Cassis. Climbing calanques in Provence France has long been a favorite pastime of residents and tourists alike. The magnificent natural creations stretch for over sixteen miles between Marseille and Cassis and are over two and a half miles wide. You can explore the enchanting Calanques from a variety of points, and hiking is available year round except for in July and August when there is an increased chance of fire from the heat.\"\n\nCredit: http://www.destination360.com/europe/france/marseille/calanques\n\nGo make someone smile, go for an adventure, go try something new!\nLet me know how it goes!

My Perspectives \u2696-  https://tinyurl.com/yy9dx5y\n\nWHO AM I? \u267b\ufe0f\nHello! My name is Max Reisinger (Rye - Singer) and I\u2019m a 17-year old student-athlete/entrepreneur/visual creative. I\u2019m currently in my last year in high school and am applying to college/university (wish me luck). I\u2019ve been creating videos here on YouTube since the beginning of 2019 when I moved to France for 7 months with my family. I attended a French public school during my time there and filmed all of my experiences/travels/new perspectives. After moving back to America, I started a business (https://perspectopia.com) and have continued to film how I use optimism to live a happy, well-balanced life. \n\nMY BUSINESS: \ud83d\udce6 (https://instagram.com/perspectopia - https://perspectopia.com)\nAt the beginning of 2020, I started a clothing brand - Perspectopia (Perspective + Utopia). My ultimate goal with this YouTube channel has always been to create a community and I strongly believe that optimistic perspectives can change your life. So, I decided to create a community based upon these ideas and also decided to create a line of clothing so that you can represent these same ideals. \n\nThe first collection launched at the beginning of 2020 where I released a limited round of 100 embroidered champion hoodies. You guys absolutely blew me away and they sold out in less than 9 minutes!!? If you want to support the Perspectopia movement and rep the brand, follow @persptopia on Instagram (https://instagram.com/perspectopia) to get updates on all future drops, updates, and behind the scenes! \n\nJOIN MY COMMUNITY: \ud83d\uddfa\nI would love for you to join the Perspectopia discord community! - https://discord.gg/s9Enjrp\nWe host weekly game nights, movie nights, discussions on different topics, language lessons, homework help, accountability groups, and much more! \nSee you there-\n\nGET IN TOUCH: \ud83d\udcf2\nIf you\u2019d like to ask me any questions, tweeting @Maxbrsee directly will be the quickest way to get a response! For any business or media inquiries please email maxreisingertv@gmail.com - I try my best to reply to dms/questions as best as I can, so please, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out with anything! \n\nPO BOX: \ud83d\udcec\n(I will try to include anything you send in future videos- thank you in advance!)\nMax Reisinger\n1500 W Main St Unit 1454\nCarrboro, NC 27510 \n\nHave a great day!\n\n\u30c5\nCurrent Sub count: 228,362!",

My Perspectives \u2696-  https://tinyurl.com/yy9dx5y\n\nWHO AM I? \u267b\ufe0f\nHello! My name is Max Reisinger (Rye - Singer) and I\u2019m a 17-year old student-athlete/entrepreneur/visual creative. I\u2019m currently in my last year in high school and am applying to college/university (wish me luck). I\u2019ve been creating videos here on YouTube since the beginning of 2019 when I moved to France for 7 months with my family. I attended a French public school during my time there and filmed all of my experiences/travels/new perspectives. After moving back to America, I started a business (https://perspectopia.com) and have continued to film how I use optimism to live a happy, well-balanced life. \n\nMY BUSINESS: \ud83d\udce6 (https://instagram.com/perspectopia - https://perspectopia.com)\nAt the beginning of 2020, I started a clothing brand - Perspectopia (Perspective + Utopia). My ultimate goal with this YouTube channel has always been to create a community and I strongly believe that optimistic perspectives can change your life. So, I decided to create a community based upon these ideas and also decided to create a line of clothing so that you can represent these same ideals. \n\nThe first collection launched at the beginning of 2020 where I released a limited round of 100 embroidered champion hoodies. You guys absolutely blew me away and they sold out in less than 9 minutes!!? If you want to support the Perspectopia movement and rep the brand, follow @persptopia on Instagram (https://instagram.com/perspectopia) to get updates on all future drops, updates, and behind the scenes! \n\nJOIN MY COMMUNITY: \ud83d\uddfa\nI would love for you to join the Perspectopia discord community! - https://discord.gg/s9Enjrp\nWe host weekly game nights, movie nights, discussions on different topics, language lessons, homework help, accountability groups, and much more! \nSee you there-\n\nGET IN TOUCH: \ud83d\udcf2\nIf you\u2019d like to ask me any questions, tweeting @Maxbrsee directly will be the quickest way to get a response! For any business or media inquiries please email maxreisingertv@gmail.com - I try my best to reply to dms/questions as best as I can, so please, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out with anything! \n\nPO BOX: \ud83d\udcec\n(I will try to include anything you send in future videos- thank you in advance!)\nMax Reisinger\n1500 W Main St Unit 1454\nCarrboro, NC 27510 \n\nHave a great day!\n\n\u30c5\nCurrent Sub count: 228,362!"

Mama also tells us about her struggles and the Norris Nuts get some unexpected news about the room allocation in their new house in Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australia.

The Norris Nuts must go shopping for the clothes outfits and any accessories that they will need from the Australian shopping mall. Once they have all their shopping items then the Norris Nuts travel to the Bogey Hole in Newcastle NSW, which is a very popular swimming location. The photo is taken near the Newcastle Ocean baths and showcases Australian holiday destinations. The Norris Nuts then come back for the judging and to see if the photos they were able to take underwater are as good as they hope! There is a mystery prize - keep watching to see exactly what it is.\nAlso soon is Naz's 11th Birthday party video and soon The Norris Nuts are looking forward to travelling out of Newcastle and to the Gold Coast, Sydney, Northern Terrirtory Australia and beyond to other countries.\n\nThanks for inspiration  @jordanmatter   and If you liked our video then go check out his channel for videos similar to this https://youtu.be/aFK7T7SjXRU\n\nCheck out our other channels here \nNORRIS NUTS GAMING http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSGAMING\nMAIN CHANNEL http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTS\nNORRIS NUTS DO STUFF http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSDOSTUFF\nNORRIS NUTS COOKING http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSCOOKING\nNORRIS NUTS CLIPS http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSCLIPS\nNORRIS NUTS SQUAD (adventures) http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSSQUAD\n\nOur MOST POPULAR VIDEOS HERE https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL92HrKDrbQZ1ljDSJdh-sQb10oYb_OsoS\n\n*Comment on our Community Tab on the Channel Page\n\nMAKE CLOSED CAPTIONS (subtitles) in your language here http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UCYd0us2OtW4d4-1cfpT2ktw&tab=2",

The Norris Nuts must go shopping for the clothes outfits and any accessories that they will need from the Australian shopping mall. Once they have all their shopping items then the Norris Nuts travel to the Bogey Hole in Newcastle NSW, which is a very popular swimming location. The photo is taken near the Newcastle Ocean baths and showcases Australian holiday destinations. The Norris Nuts then come back for the judging and to see if the photos they were able to take underwater are as good as they hope! There is a mystery prize - keep watching to see exactly what it is.\nAlso soon is Naz's 11th Birthday party video and soon The Norris Nuts are looking forward to travelling out of Newcastle and to the Gold Coast, Sydney, Northern Terrirtory Australia and beyond to other countries.\n\nThanks for inspiration  @jordanmatter   and If you liked our video then go check out his channel for videos similar to this https://youtu.be/aFK7T7SjXRU\n\nCheck out our other channels here \nNORRIS NUTS GAMING http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSGAMING\nMAIN CHANNEL http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTS\nNORRIS NUTS DO STUFF http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSDOSTUFF\nNORRIS NUTS COOKING http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSCOOKING\nNORRIS NUTS CLIPS http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSCLIPS\nNORRIS NUTS SQUAD (adventures) http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSSQUAD\n\nOur MOST POPULAR VIDEOS HERE https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL92HrKDrbQZ1ljDSJdh-sQb10oYb_OsoS\n\n*Comment on our Community Tab on the Channel Page\n\nMAKE CLOSED CAPTIONS (subtitles) in your language here http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UCYd0us2OtW4d4-1cfpT2ktw&tab=2"

Whoever buys the best present will get a surprise Mystery Box which will contain an Item or Note with a special prize for that person to win. Last time Sabre won a a Norris Nuts holiday for her to choose anywhere she wants to go. Sabre also researches on her computer all the places in the United States USA and United Kingdom UK that she could pick for the family holiday. Sockie is also scared of coming to the USA because of their different rules.

We also hear somemore information about Biggy's crush. The challenge starts with each Norris Nut getting $100 budget to spend in order to purchase the presents for Sabre/ Sabre will then open all the presents and judge whoever was the best present giver. Whoever buys the best present will get a surprise Mystery Box which will contain an Item or Note with a special prize for that person to win. Last time Sabre won a a Norris Nuts holiday for her to choose anywhere she wants to go. Sabre also researches on her computer all the places in the United States USA and United Kingdom UK that she could pick for the family holiday. Sockie is also scared of coming to the USA because of their different rules. Make sure you let us know who you thought bought Sabre Norris the best present and see if you agree with Sabre's decision. \nCheck out our other channels here \nNORRIS NUTS GAMING http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSGAMING\nMAIN CHANNEL http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTS\nNORRIS NUTS DO STUFF http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSDOSTUFF\nNORRIS NUTS SQUAD (adventures) http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSSQUAD\n\nOur MOST POPULAR VIDEOS HERE https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL92HrKDrbQZ1ljDSJdh-sQb10oYb_OsoS\n\n\n*Comment on our Community Tab on the Channel Page\n\nMAKE CLOSED CAPTIONS (subtitles) in your language here http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UCYd0us2OtW4d4-1cfpT2ktw&tab=2"

When she cuts the cake she wishes for a guinea pig. Naz has always wanted a pet. Sabre, Sockie, Biggy and Mama all go to the shopping center to buy Naz the best present. Naz and Papa Justin go to the party supplies shop to get stuff for the birthday party. Biggy has a funny joke to play on Naz when she wakes up in the morning. The Norris Nuts go for a surf on their birthday as a tradition. Once the Norris Nuts buy all the presents, gifts and surprises for Naz, then they come home and show Naz. Hope Naz gets her favourite things for the birthday party.\n\n\nCheck out our other channels here \nNORRIS NUTS GAMING http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSGAMING\nMAIN CHANNEL http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTS\nNORRIS NUTS DO STUFF http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSDOSTUFF\nNORRIS NUTS SQUAD (adventures) http://bit.ly/NORRISNUTSSQUAD\n\nOur MOST POPULAR VIDEOS HERE https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL92HrKDrbQZ1ljDSJdh-sQb10oYb_OsoS\n\n*Comment on our Community Tab on the Channel Page\n\nMAKE CLOSED CAPTIONS (subtitles) in your language here http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UCYd0us2OtW4d4-1cfpT2ktw&tab=2"
